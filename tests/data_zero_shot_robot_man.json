            "summary": "We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping."

            "summary": "In this paper, we study the problem of learning vision-based dynamic manipulation skills using a scalable reinforcement learning approach. We study this problem in the context of grasping, a longstanding challenge in robotic manipulation. In contrast to static learning behaviors that choose a grasp point and then execute the desired grasp, our method enables closed-loop vision-based control, whereby the robot continuously updates its grasp strategy based on the most recent observations to optimize long-horizon grasp success. To that end, we introduce QT-Opt, a scalable self-supervised vision-based reinforcement learning framework that can leverage over 580k real-world grasp attempts to train a deep neural network Q-function with over 1.2M parameters to perform closed-loop, real-world grasping that generalizes to 96% grasp success on unseen objects. Aside from attaining a very high success rate, our method exhibits behaviors that are quite distinct from more standard grasping systems: using only RGB vision-based perception from an over-the-shoulder camera, our method automatically learns regrasping strategies, probes objects to find the most effective grasps, learns to reposition objects and perform other non-prehensile pre-grasp manipulations, and responds dynamically to disturbances and perturbations.

            "summary": "Prompt-based learning has emerged as a successful paradigm in natural language processing, where a single general-purpose language model can be instructed to perform any task specified by input prompts. Yet task specification in robotics comes in various forms, such as imitating one-shot demonstrations, following language instructions, and reaching visual goals. They are often considered different tasks and tackled by specialized models. We show that a wide spectrum of robot manipulation tasks can be expressed with multimodal prompts, interleaving textual and visual tokens. Accordingly, we develop a new simulation benchmark that consists of thousands of procedurally-generated tabletop tasks with multimodal prompts, 600K+ expert trajectories for imitation learning, and a four-level evaluation protocol for systematic generalization. We design a transformer-based robot agent, VIMA, that processes these prompts and outputs motor actions autoregressively. VIMA features a recipe that achieves strong model scalability and data efficiency. It outperforms alternative designs in the hardest zero-shot generalization setting by up to   task success rate given the same training data. With   less training data, VIMA still performs   better than the best competing variant"

            "summary": "Large language models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the world. Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack real-world experience, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by means of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model's hands and eyes, while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level skills can be combined with large language models so that the language model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally-extended instructions, while value functions associated with these skills provide the grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world grounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

            "summary": "he successful operation of mobile robots requires them to adapt rapidly to environmental changes. To develop an adaptive decision-making tool for mobile robots, we propose a novel algorithm that combines meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) with model predictive control (MPC). Our method employs an off-policy meta-RL algorithm as a baseline to train a policy using transition samples generated by MPC when the robot detects certain events that can be effectively handled by MPC, with its explicit use of robot dynamics. The key idea of our method is to switch between the meta-learned policy and the MPC controller in a randomized and event-triggered fashion to make up for suboptimal MPC actions caused by the limited prediction horizon. During meta-testing, the MPC module is deactivated to significantly reduce computation time in motion control. We further propose an online adaptation scheme that enables the robot to infer and adapt to a new task within a single trajectory. The performance of our method has been demonstrated through simulations using a nonlinear car-like vehicle model with (i) synthetic movements of obstacles, and (ii) real-world pedestrian motion data. The simulation results indicate that our method outperforms other algorithms in terms of learning efficiency and navigation quality."

The affordance representation is learned during a behavioral babbling stage in which the robot randomly chooses different exploratory behaviors, applies them to the tool, and observes their effects on environmental objects. As a result of this exploratory procedure, the tool representation is grounded in the behavioral and perceptual repertoire of the robot. Furthermore, the representation is autonomously testable and verifiable by the robot as it is expressed in concrete terms (i.e., behaviors) that are directly available to the robot’s controller. The tool representation described here can also be used to solve tool-using tasks by dynamically sequencing the exploratory behaviors which were used to explore the tool based on their expected outcomes. The quality of the learned representation was tested on extension-of-reach tasks with rigid tools."

In robotics we often want to solve a multitude of different, but related tasks. As the parameters of the primitives are typically high dimensional, a common practice for the generalization of movement primitives to new tasks is to adapt only a small set of control variables, also called meta parameters, of the primitive. Yet, for most MP representations, the encoding of these control variables is pre-coded in the representation and can not be adapted to the considered tasks. In this paper, we want to learn the encoding of task-specific control variables also from data instead of relying on fixed meta-parameter representations. We use hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) to estimate a low dimensional latent variable model for probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs), which is a recent movement primitive representation. We show on two real robot datasets that ProMPs based on HBMs outperform standard ProMPs in terms of generalization and learning from a small amount of data and also allows for an intuitive analysis of the movement. We also extend our HBM by a mixture model, such that we can model different movement types in the same dataset."

            "summary": "Bruce et al. address the challenge of learning navigation policies for mobile robots with minimal        real‑world interaction. The primary contribution is an “interactive replay” framework that constructs a virtual        training environment from a single traversal of a known office space, thereby generating massive amounts of            synthetic experience for model‑free reinforcement learning. Complementary contributions include the integration of     a frozen ImageNet‑pretrained ResNet‑50 visual encoder and the introduction of stochastic observation augmentation      to mitigate over‑fitting and enable zero‑shot transfer to unseen environmental variations. \n\nThe methodology         proceeds in four stages. First, the robot records a full pass through the target area; a lightweight                   human‑in‑the‑loop or autonomous SLAM pipeline then aligns the data into a topological pose graph with nodes spaced     at 10 cm and orientations at 90° increments. Second, a second traversal collected on a different day provides a        validation graph that is loosely aligned using laser‑based localization, exposing the agent to realistic lighting,     furniture, and dynamic‑obstacle changes. Third, each node’s visual observation is encoded by a fixed ResNet‑50,        concatenating four 90° camera crops into an 8192‑dimensional feature vector; freezing the encoder allows               pre‑computation and prevents the policy network from over‑specialising on the limited visual diversity. Fourth,        the authors employ a bootstrapped double‑dueling n‑step Q‑learning algorithm with ten parallel Q‑heads, each           trained on a random subset of experiences, to encourage diverse exploration and to provide an implicit uncertainty     estimate. Stochasticity is injected by sampling observation positions and headings from Gaussian distributions         (σ=5 cm, σ=5°) around the true pose, effectively augmenting the dataset without additional real‑world data.            \n\nEmpirically, agents trained for 300 M virtual frames achieve near‑optimal worst‑case rewards (R_min ≥ 13) on       the training graph and retain approximately 85 % of this performance on the validation graph, outperforming A2C        and single‑head Q‑learning baselines. Ablation studies reveal that pre‑trained visual features improve validation      transfer by reducing the performance gap, while stochastic observation augmentation dramatically enhances both         training stability and generalisation. The bootstrapped ensemble further yields superior minimum‑episode scores,       confirming its suitability for safety‑critical navigation where reliable performance from any start state is           essential. \n\nDespite these strengths, the work exhibits several limitations. The reliance on a discretised pose      graph and coarse, deterministic actions (turn‑left/right, forward) sidesteps continuous control and low‑level          motion planning, raising concerns about the feasibility of closed‑loop deployment where actuator noise and             obstacle avoidance are non‑trivial. The validation set, although collected on a separate day, still shares the         same global topology; the approach may struggle with more substantial structural changes (e.g., added corridors)       or outdoor environments where lighting and geometry vary dramatically. Moreover, the stochastic augmentation           assumes Gaussian localisation errors, which may not capture systematic biases of visual odometry or dynamic            occlusions. Finally, the method presumes access to a 360° camera and reliable laser localisation for graph             alignment, limiting applicability to platforms lacking such sensors. \n\nFuture work should explore integration        with continuous motion controllers, investigate domain‑randomisation techniques that model more diverse                environmental perturbations, and evaluate the framework on heterogeneous spaces with evolving topologies.              Extending interactive replay to incorporate multimodal sensory streams and to learn hierarchical policies could        further bridge the gap between simulated experience and robust real‑world robot navigation."

The authors identify two shortcomings of prior CZSL methods: (1) all   │ │  branches typically share a single high‑level feature map, which limits discrimination of visually similar           │ │  compositions, and (2) spatial cues are not exchanged among branches, leading to inconsistent attention.\n\n####     │ │  Core Contributions\n1. **Multi‑Level Feature Aggregation (MFA)** – An aggregation predictor takes the input image   │ │  and the low‑, middle‑, and high‑level feature maps extracted from a *frozen* ResNet‑18 backbone. It outputs         │ │  instance‑specific weights for each level, producing customized feature vectors for the attribute, object, and       │ │  composition branches. This allows, for example, the attribute branch to emphasize low‑level texture cues (e.g.,     │ │  “old”) while the object branch relies more on high‑level semantic cues.\n2. **Focus‑Consistent Constraint** –       │ │  Instead of global average pooling, each branch uses attention pooling to generate an attention map. A               │ │  cosine‑similarity loss forces the sum of the attribute and object attention maps to align with the                  │ │  composition‑branch attention map, thereby sharing spatial information and preventing any branch from being misled   │ │  by irrelevant regions.\n\n#### Experimental Findings\n- **Datasets & Protocol**: Evaluated on UT‑Zappos, C‑GQA,     │ │  and Clothing16K under the generalized CZSL setting with calibrated bias. A ResNet‑18 backbone is kept frozen        │ │  throughout training.\n- **Quantitative Performance** (Table 2):\n  - *UT‑Zappos*: Unseen composition accuracy **U   │ │  = 68.0 %**, the highest among all baselines; AUC **33.1**, matching the best reported value.\n  - *C‑GQA*: Unseen   │ │  accuracy **U = 15.2 %**, AUC **3.8**, and harmonic mean **HM = 15.2**, surpassing prior state‑of‑the‑art            │ │  methods.\n  - *Clothing16K*: Unseen accuracy **U = 96.0 %**, AUC **90.1 %**, and HM **88.9**, again the best        │ │  reported numbers.\n- **Ablation Studies** confirm that both the MFA module and the focus‑consistent loss            │ │  contribute synergistically: random feature selection or removal of the attention‑based loss degrades performance,   │ │  while the learned aggregation predictor yields superior results compared with uniform or single‑level feature       │ │  usage.\n- **Qualitative Analysis** shows that the aggregation predictor assigns higher weights to low‑level         │ │  features for the attribute branch and to higher‑level features for the object branch, with the composition branch   │ │  receiving a balanced mixture. Attention maps become more concentrated on semantically relevant regions when the     │ │  focus‑consistent constraint is active.\n\n#### Limitations & Future Directions\n- The backbone is frozen, which     │ │  may limit adaptation of low‑level representations to the specific CZSL task.\n- MFA only aggregates the last three  │ │  convolutional stages; earlier layers were found to hurt performance in the authors’ experiments, but this may be    │ │  dataset‑dependent.\n- The focus‑consistent loss assumes a linear additive relationship between attribute and        │ │  object attentions, which might not hold for attributes that fundamentally alter object shape.\n- Experiments are    │ │  limited to three closed‑world benchmarks; extending to open‑world CZSL and leveraging richer semantic priors        │ │  (e.g., graph‑based relations) remain promising avenues.\n\nOverall, FOMA introduces a principled way to provide     │ │  each branch with level‑appropriate features while enforcing consistent spatial focus, leading to state‑of‑the‑art   │ │  results across all three evaluated CZSL datasets."

Second, the         │ │  zero‑shot VLMs exhibit high false‑positive rates; although the proposal‑approval step mitigates this, it            │ │  introduces additional latency and still depends on the second VLM’s robustness to ambiguous language.

Fourth, user hints are treated as hard priors; misleading hints degrade SPL   │ │  and can cause inefficient replanning, revealing sensitivity to instruction quality. Finally, experiments are        │ │  confined to a single indoor arena with modest dynamic changes; broader validation on diverse domains (e.g.,         │ │  outdoor or densely cluttered spaces) and with multiple cooperating robots is absent, leaving open questions about   │ │  generalization and collaborative scalability. Future work should therefore explore adaptive exploration             │ │  strategies, end‑to‑end learned fusion of perception and planning, and multi‑agent extensions to overcome these      │ │  constraints."

The authors argue that natural language provides an intuitive, widely‑accessible            │ │  supervision signal that can both simplify data collection and enable policy learning for non‑experts.\n\n###        │ │  Contributions\n1. **Language‑based teleoperation framework** – lay users give verbal commands (e.g., “move the arm  │ │  to the right”). A large‑language model translates each command into a concrete robotic behavior, which the robot    │ │  executes to generate demonstration trajectories.\n2. **Stochastic Trajectory Augmentation (STA)** – after a         │ │  demonstration is recorded, STA stochastically perturbs the robot into novel states, automatically labels the        │ │  resulting behavior with a simple heuristic, and thus expands the diversity of the dataset.\n3. **CLIP‑RT model** –  │ │  a Vision‑Language‑Action (VLA) architecture that adapts the pretrained CLIP model. It encodes the current visual    │ │  observation sequence together with the instruction prompt to obtain a *context* embedding \\(c_i\\), and encodes    │ │  each candidate motion primitive (expressed in natural language, e.g., “move the arm left”) to obtain a *action*     │ │  embedding \\(z_j\\). A contrastive imitation‑learning loss maximizes the cosine similarity for matching             │ │  context‑action pairs while minimizing it for mismatched pairs.\n4. **Training pipeline** –\n   - *Pre‑training* on  │ │  the large‑scale Open X‑Embodiment dataset (which contains only low‑level robot actions). The authors automatically  │ │  transform these actions into templated natural‑language descriptions to provide language supervision for            │ │  CLIP‑RT.\n   - *In‑domain fine‑tuning* using the data collected with the proposed teleoperation + STA               │ │  framework.\n5. **Empirical results** –\n   - On real‑world manipulation tasks, CLIP‑RT achieves a **24 % absolute   │ │  improvement** in average success rate over OpenVLA while using **7× fewer parameters** (1 B vs. 7 B) and running    │ │  at **163 Hz** inference throughput.\n   - On the simulated LIBERO benchmark, CLIP‑RT attains a **92.8 % success     │ │  rate**.\n   - Ablations show that both the language‑based motion‑prediction component and STA substantially boost   │ │  few‑shot generalization and collaborative scenarios with large pretrained language models.\n\n### Key               │ │  Takeaway\nThe work demonstrates that natural‑language supervision, combined with a contrastive VLA model and        │ │  simple trajectory augmentation, can enable non‑experts to collect diverse robot demonstrations and train compact,   │ │  high‑performing policies that rival larger state‑of‑the‑art models.\n"

It introduces **\"2025 cognitive flow\"**, an extension of classic flow theory tailored to  │ │  AI‑augmented reasoning tasks, and reports that the work was presented at the **2025 ACM Workshop on Human‑AI        │ │  Interaction for Augmented Reasoning**.\n\n### Core Idea\nThe authors argue that effective cognitive support must    │ │  be **context‑aware** so that AI interventions preserve—or deliberately restore—the user’s state of cognitive flow.  │ │  They identify three contextual dimensions—**type, timing, and scale**—which they collectively frame as              │ │  **\"context\"** that guides dynamic adaptation of assistance.\n\n### Adaptive Framework\n1. **Bidirectional         │ │  Challenge Management**: The framework intervenes when a task is **too hard** (providing just‑enough support such    │ │  as fact‑checking or Socratic prompts) and also **raises the challenge when a task is overly easy** by injecting     │ │  counter‑arguments, critiques, or prompting deeper reflection.\n2. **Multimodal Inference Pipeline**: Real‑time      │ │  behavioral cues—gaze behavior, typing hesitation, interaction speed, and physiological signals—are mapped to user   │ │  engagement levels to infer the current flow state.\n3. **Longitudinal User Modeling**: Engagement data collected    │ │  over time are used to **cluster users by reasoning style**, enabling the system to personalize the choice of        │ │  intervention type, intensity, and timing for each individual.\n\n### Proposed Evaluation\nTo assess **Cognitive     │ │  Flow Alignment**, the authors advocate a **mixed‑method evaluation framework** that combines **behavioral           │ │  analytics** (e.g., metrics of gaze aversion, typing errors, interaction velocity) with **subjective feedback**      │ │  (user‑reported sense of agency and immersion). This approach moves evaluation beyond raw task‑performance gains     │ │  toward measuring how well AI systems regulate cognitive flow.\n\n### Contributions and Limitations\n- **Conceptual  │ │  contribution**: A contextual, flow‑preserving augmentation paradigm that shifts from static, one‑size‑fits‑all      │ │  interventions to adaptive, user‑centred support.\n- **Technical sketch**: An architecture that integrates recent    │ │  multimodal large‑scale models with a decision‑making module selecting intervention parameters based on inferred     │ │  flow state.\n- **Illustrative scenarios**: Examples showing the system dialing down support when disengagement is   │ │  detected (e.g., prolonged gaze aversion) and scaling up challenge when the user appears under‑stimulated (e.g.,     │ │  low cognitive load).\n- **Limitations noted**: Dependence on high‑fidelity sensors, potential privacy concerns,     │ │  the need for robust validation of cue‑to‑flow mappings across individuals, and the current lack of quantitative     │ │  user studies.\n\nIn sum, the paper proposes a promising direction for AI‑driven cognitive augmentation by           │ │  foregrounding **context‑aware, flow‑preserving interventions** and outlining concrete mechanisms—multimodal         │ │  sensing, longitudinal clustering, and mixed‑method evaluation—to realize **2025 cognitive flow** in reasoning       │ │  support systems."

(2026) investigate the largely overlooked capability of vision‑language models (VLMs) to  │ │  perform spatial reasoning that relies on visual imagination rather than linguistic inference. To this end they      │ │  introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate both the accuracy and the token‑efficiency   │ │  of spatial cognition across five task families: Mental Rotation, Cube Rolling, Rubik’s Cube, Moving Box (Sokoban),  │ │  and Wood Slide (Huarongdao). Each task is procedurally generated with controllable difficulty parameters (e.g.,     │ │  number of cubes, path tortuosity, obstacle density) and annotated with optimal solution trajectories, thereby       │ │  eliminating manual labeling and enabling unlimited scalability. The authors further propose an Imagery‑Driven       │ │  Framework (IDF), a two‑stage training pipeline that first distills large‑scale visual‑imagery data (Imagery         │ │  Distillation) and then performs reasoning‑distillation on pseudo‑trajectories derived from strong VLMs. This        │ │  pipeline is intended to endow models with an internal spatial world model that can simulate transformations,        │ │  predict egocentric‑allocentric changes, and support strategic planning.\n\nExtensive experiments on twelve          │ │  proprietary and open‑source VLMs—including DeepSeek‑R1, GPT‑4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, and the Qwen 2.5 VL           │ │  family—reveal three salient patterns. First, all models achieve superhuman performance on linguistically‑centric    │ │  tasks (e.g., Cube Rolling) by mapping spatial configurations onto symbolic descriptions, yet they fall              │ │  dramatically short on visual‑centric tasks such as Mental Rotation, where accuracy is about 20 % (Gemini 2.5 Pro    │ │  achieves 20.5 %). Second, token consumption grows exponentially with task complexity for visual‑centric reasoning,  │ │  indicating severe inefficiency: on hard Wood Slide instances models generate >10 k tokens, far exceeding the token  │ │  budgets typical for mathematical reasoning. Third, the IDF pipeline yields consistent gains on tasks that benefit   │ │  from visual imagination (e.g., a 7.5 % absolute increase on Rubik’s Cube) while offering negligible or negative     │ │  impact on models that already rely on pure linguistic processing (e.g., o4‑mini). The authors attribute these       │ │  trends to a dominant reliance on linguistic world models, insufficient structured 3‑D representations, and limited  │ │  transformation‑prediction mechanisms within current VLM architectures.\n\nDespite its contributions, the work       │ │  exhibits several limitations. The synthetic nature of SpatiaLite, while advantageous for scalability, may not       │ │  capture the noise, occlusion, and texture variability present in real‑world imagery, potentially inflating          │ │  reported performance gaps. Moreover, the benchmark focuses exclusively on discrete, puzzle‑like environments;       │ │  continuous navigation or embodied robotics scenarios remain unexplored, limiting the generality of the findings.    │ │  The IDF framework assumes access to high‑quality pseudo‑trajectories from strong VLMs, which may not be available   │ │  for emerging models, introducing a dependency bias. Finally, the evaluation metric of token‑efficiency conflates    │ │  model size, decoding strategy, and prompt design, obscuring the precise source of inefficiency. Future work should  │ │  extend SpatiaLite to photorealistic domains, incorporate multimodal depth or point‑cloud inputs, and develop        │ │  architecture‑agnostic mechanisms—such as differentiable spatial memory or graph‑based scene graphs—to more          │ │  faithfully emulate human‑like visuospatial imagination."

Synthesis   │ │  of Trends\nAcross these works there is a clear convergence toward **leveraging minimal but high‑quality data**,     │ │  **natural‑language interfaces**, and **efficient generative models** to enable robust navigation, manipulation,     │ │  reasoning, and creative generation. Shared challenges include reliance on specific sensors (e.g., 360° cameras for  │ │  some navigation setups), discretised action spaces, heuristic exploration strategies, and privacy‑sensitive         │ │  multimodal sensing. Addressing these limitations will be crucial for broader deployment of embodied AI systems."
