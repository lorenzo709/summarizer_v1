            "summary": "Platinum-based catalysts have been considered the most effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in water splitting. However, platinum utilization in these electrocatalysts is extremely low, as the active sites are only located on the surface of the catalyst particles. Downsizing catalyst nanoparticles to single atoms is highly desirable to maximize their efficiency by utilizing nearly all platinum atoms. Here we report on a practical synthesis method to produce isolated single platinum atoms and clusters using the atomic layer deposition technique. The single platinum atom catalysts are investigated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, where they exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activity (up to 37 times) and high stability in comparison with the state-of-the-art commercial platinum/carbon catalysts. The X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory analyses indicate that the partially unoccupied density of states of the platinum atoms’ 5d orbitals on the nitrogen-doped graphene are responsible for the excellent performance."

            "summary": "The anodic O2 evolution reaction (OER) at noble-metal anodes provides an important case of electro- catalysis where the electrode surface on which the reaction proceeds depends on potential, through the state of the surface of a thin oxide film developed upon it. An essential but little examined aspect of electrocatalysis is the behavior of the kinetically involved intermediates of the reaction at the electrode's surface in relation to the potential dependence of the electrode reaction rate, characterized by the Tafel slope. Digitally recorded potential relaxation transients following current interruption are used, as in our previous studies on cathodic H2 evolution, to evaluate the pseudocapacitance (C_) of intermediates generated in the steady state of the OER at Pt and hence the potential dependence of coverage by the kinetically significant intermediate states in the reaction. In the case of the OER proceeding as it always does on an oxidized surface of the metal, the intermediate states are not only OH and O species but probably also two or more oxidation states of Pt ions in the oxide film acting as a mediator couple in the O2 evolution kinetics. The involvement of such a couple may influence electron transfer through the oxide film. The derived C is found to be logarithmically related to potential over two distinguish- able ranges, corresponding to the observed changes of the Tafel slope of the OER. The slopes of these log C vs potential plots are, however, unexpectedly small, a result that may originate from strong lat- eral interaction effects or partial charge transfer in the deposition of the intermediates."

            "summary": "A comparative investigation was performed to examine the intrinsic catalytic activity and durability of carbon supported Ru, Ir, and Pt nanoparticles and corresponding bulk materials for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical surface characteristics of nanoparticles and bulk materials were studied by surface-sensitive cyclic voltammetry. Although basically similar voltammetric features were observed for nanoparticles and bulk materials of each metal, some differences were uncovered highlighting the changes in oxidation chemistry. On the basis of the electrochemical results, we demonstrated that Ru nanoparticles show lower passivation potentials compared to bulk Ru material. Ir nanoparticles completely lost their voltammetric metallic features during the voltage cycling, in contrast to the corresponding bulk material. Finally, Pt nanoparticles show an increased oxophilic nature compared to bulk Pt. With regard to the OER performance, the most pronounced effects of nanoscaling were identified for Ru and Pt catalysts. In particular, the Ru nanoparticles suffered from strong corrosion at applied OER potentials and were therefore unable to sustain the OER. The Pt nanoparticles exhibited a lower OER activity from the beginning on and were completely deactivated during the applied OER stability protocol, in contrast to the corresponding bulk Pt catalyst. We highlight that the OER activity and durability were comparable for Ir nanoparticles and bulk materials. Thus, Ir nanoparticles provide a high potential as nanoscaled OER catalyst."

However, the widespread adoption of efficient electrocatalysts, such as platinum (Pt), has been hindered by their high cost. In this study, we developed an easy-to-implement method to create ultrathin Pt nanomembranes, which catalyze HER at a cost significantly lower than commercial Pt/C and comparable to non-noble metal electrocatalysts. These Pt nanomembranes consist of highly distorted Pt nanocrystals and exhibit a heterogeneous elastic strain field, a characteristic rarely seen in conventional crystals. This unique feature results in significantly higher electrocatalytic efficiency than various forms of Pt electrocatalysts, including Pt/C, Pt foils, and numerous Pt single-atom or single-cluster catalysts. Our research offers a promising approach to develop highly efficient and cost-effective low-dimensional electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production, potentially addressing the challenges posed by the climate crisis."

Platinum, the state-of-the-art electrocatalyst for hydrogen oxidation in fuel cells or hydrogen evolution in water splitting, is generally considered to be stable and little attention has been paid to its authentic structure during the hydrogen oxidation/evolution electrocatalysis. Herein, we disclose the in situ generation of surface hydrides on sub-2-nm Pt nanoparticles working under the electrode potentials of hydrogen electrocatalysis, showing the migration of surface-adsorbed hydrogen to interstitial hydrogen at the Pt subsurface. While weakening the metal-support interaction and inducing particle coalescence/detachment, the in situ generated surface hydride optimizes the binding energy of surface Pt with adsorbed hydrogen, leading to overall enhanced activities on hydrogen oxidation/evolution. The smaller the particle size, the lower the energy barrier for surface hydride formation, and consequently the more significant the activity enhancement, resulting in a pronounced particle size effect during long-term hydrogen electrocatalysis."

In this study, a low platinum (Pt) bimetallic phosphide heterostructure (Pt-NiFe-P/NF), derived from three-dimensional NiFe metal–organic framework (NiFe-MOF) nanorods on nickel foam (NF), was developed using a two-step hydrothermal and phosphorization process. The nickel-iron phosphide nanorod array heterostructure boasts a large surface area with numerous active sites, which enhances charge and substance transfer. The integration of metallic Pt with NiFe-P heterostructures subtly adjusts the electronic redistribution between them, thereby improving the kinetics of water splitting. Consequently, the Pt-NiFe-P/NF catalyst demonstrated exceptional HER and OER performance in a 1 M KOH solution, with overpotentials of 97 and 266 mV at 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Remarkably, an electrolyzer utilizing this catalyst requires just a 1.65 V potential to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm−2, exceeding the capabilities of conventional Pt/C||RuO2 systems, which require 2.10 V and outperforming many advanced electrochemical water splitting catalysts currently in use."

In this work, platinum nanoparticles bonded in carbon nanotubes (Pt-NPs-bonded@CNT) with strong Pt–C bonds are designed toward ultralow overpotential water splitting ability in alkaline solution. Benefit from the strong interaction between platinum and high conductivity carbon nanotube substrates through the Pt–C bond also the platinum nanoparticles bonded in carbon nanotube can provide more stable active sites, as a result, the Pt-NPs-bonded@CNT exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution in acid and alkaline solution with ultralow overpotential of 0.19 and 0.23 V to reach 1000 mA cm–2, respectively. Besides, it shows superior oxygen evolution electrocatalysis in alkaline solution with a low overpotential of 1.69 V at 1000 mA cm–2. Furthermore, it also exhibits high stability over 110 h against the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen at 1000 mA cm–2.

To better understand how its activity can be modulated through electrolyte effects in the double layer microenvironment, herein we investigate the effects of different acid anions on platinum for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) and hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) in pH 1 electrolytes. Experimentally, we see the ORR activity trend of HClO4 > HNO3 > H2SO4, and the OER activity trend of HClO4 HNO3 ∼ H2SO4. HER/HOR performance is similar across all three electrolytes. Notably, we demonstrate that ORR performance can be improved 4-fold in nitric acid compared to in sulfuric acid. Assessing the potential-dependent role of relative anion competitive adsorption with density functional theory, we calculate unfavorable adsorption on Pt(111) for all the anions at HER/HOR conditions while under ORR/OER conditions binds the weakest followed by and . Our combined experimental-theoretical work highlights the importance of understanding the role of anions across a large potential range and reveals nitrate-like electrolyte microenvironments as interesting possible sulfonate alternatives to mitigate the catalyst poisoning effects of polymer membranes/ionomers in electrochemical systems.

    "final_summary_gpt": "### Introduction Platinum (Pt) has long stood as the benchmark electrocatalyst for water splitting due to its unrivaled activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a key half-reaction in electrochemical hydrogen production. Electrochemical water splitting comprises two simultaneous processes: HER at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, both of which involve kinetically sluggish multielectron transfer steps that must be catalyzed to achieve practical rates under minimal overpotentials. Benchmark studies have established that Pt exhibits the most favorable hydrogen binding energy among pure metals, placing it near the apex of the HER activity volcano plot and rationalizing its exceptional performance in acidic electrolytes. ([Nature][1]) Furthermore, while Pt’s intrinsic activity for OER is comparatively modest, its role as a component in hybrid water-splitting catalysts reflects its importance in integrated electrolyzer designs. ([American Chemical Society Publications][2]) Modern efforts to enhance Pt’s performance for water splitting revolve around optimizing surface structure, dispersion, and support interactions to increase active site utilization and mitigate cost constraints imposed by Pt’s scarcity. Nanostructuring strategies, such as the fabrication of ultrathin Pt nanomembranes or sub-2 nm Pt nanoparticles, demonstrate substantial improvements in HER activity at dramatically reduced Pt loadings, often attributed to increased surface area and altered electronic structure under reaction conditions. ([Springer][3]) Single-atom and cluster catalysts extend this concept by maximizing atom economy, significantly enhancing HER kinetics relative to conventional Pt/C benchmarks by exposing nearly all Pt atoms as active sites. ([Nature][1]) Beyond simple dispersion, the electronic environment of Pt can be deliberately tuned via alloying and heterostructure engineering, which has been shown to accelerate both HER and OER kinetics in alkaline electrolytes by facilitating charge transfer and lowering reaction overpotentials. ([RSC Publishing][4]) Likewise, strong metal–support interactions, exemplified by Pt nanoparticles strongly bonded to conductive substrates like carbon nanotubes, can produce bifunctional catalysts with robust HER and OER performance and operational stability under industrially relevant current densities. ([American Chemical Society Publications][5]) In addition to electrochemical systems, Pt also functions effectively as a cocatalyst in photocatalytic water splitting when integrated with narrow-bandgap semiconductor hosts, where its presence enhances charge separation and surface reaction kinetics under light irradiation. ([RSC Publishing][6]) These composite materials illustrate how Pt’s catalytic properties can be harnessed across diverse water-splitting modalities, bridging photoelectrochemical and purely electrochemical platforms. Despite such progress, challenges remain in balancing activity, durability, and cost, particularly for alkaline water splitting where kinetic barriers to water dissociation persist. ([RSC Publishing][7]) Addressing these issues requires a detailed mechanistic understanding of HER/OER on Pt surfaces and further innovation in catalyst design, such as interface and electronic microenvironment engineering. ([backend.orbit.dtu.dk][8]) Ultimately, advances in Pt-based catalysis will play a decisive role in enabling scalable, efficient hydrogen production essential for a sustainable energy future.",

            "summary": "Lu et al. (2022) tackle the low solar‑light utilization that limits photodegradation‑based water treatment by introducing surface microlenses (MLs) fabricated from polymerized surface nanodroplets. The MLs are produced via a solvent‑exchange process that nucleates methyl methacrylate (MMA) nanodroplets on octadecyltrichlorosilane‑treated glass; the droplets are then UV‑cured into poly(methyl methacrylate) lenses. By varying the flow‑rate during solvent exchange, the authors control droplet size, surface coverage, and lens curvature. Two fabrication routes are examined: 1. **Random MLs** on a homogeneous hydrophobic substrate (size tuned by flow‑rate 30–90 mL h⁻¹).  2. **Ordered ML arrays** on a pre‑patterned substrate with 5 µm circular hydrophobic domains spaced 10 µm apart; arrays are produced with one or two rounds of solvent exchange (ML array 1 and ML array 2, respectively).  Optical characterization shows >97 % visible‑light transmission for all ML‑decorated glasses and focal intensities up to five orders of magnitude higher for the arrayed lenses. Photodegradation experiments use methyl orange (MO) as a model dye and three clinically relevant antibiotics—norfloxacin (NFX), sulfadiazine (SFD) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ)—under simulated solar illumination.  **Key quantitative results** - Random MLs fabricated at a flow‑rate of 70 mL h⁻¹ increase the MO degradation efficiency (η) by 186 % compared with a bare surface.  - **ML array 1** (one‑round solvent exchange) yields a 471 % increase in η, while **ML array 2** (two‑round solvent exchange) provides a 607 % increase, demonstrating the advantage of higher curvature and ordered arrangement.  - A roughly linear correlation is observed between η and the summed focal intensities obtained from Zemax simulations for random MLs; ordered arrays exhibit a synergistic “regional effect” that makes them ~100 % more effective than random MLs with the same summed intensity.  - In the bottle proof‑of‑concept, MLs coated on the inner wall of glass vials accelerate antibiotic degradation: after 4 h of simulated solar light, NFX degrades 1.2 × faster (≈30 % improvement), SFD 2.6 × faster (≈160 % improvement), and SMZ 1.9 × faster (≈90 % improvement) compared with bare vials.  - Under indoor sunlight, methyl orange in ML‑functionalized bottles shows a 9–23 × enhancement in degradation after 9–12 days, with larger MLs (vials 2 and 3) performing better than smaller MLs (vial 1).  **Practical considerations** noted by the authors include the reliance on flow‑rate control for precise ML size and curvature, and the need for further testing under natural sunlight to confirm performance in real‑world conditions. The study demonstrates that surface MLs—especially highly ordered arrays—can dramatically boost solar‑driven photodegradation without altering the underlying degradation pathways, offering a low‑cost, scalable optical augmentation strategy that could reduce the collector area required for wastewater remediation.

            "paper_id": "Autocatalytic and cooperatively-stabilized dissociation of water on a stepped platinum surface.pdf ",
            "summary": "**Study focus** – Donadio, Ghiringhelli, and Delle Site investigate how low‑dimensional metal steps influence water chemistry by examining adsorption and partial dissociation of water on a stepped Pt(221) surface. This is relevant for catalysis, corrosion, and electrochemical devices.  **Key contribution** – The authors identify an autocatalytic, cooperatively‑stabilized dissociation mechanism: water molecules preferentially bind at step edges, form linear hydrogen‑bonded clusters or wires, and promote deprotonation of a fraction of the adsorbates. The resulting mixed H₂O/OH structures could act as proton‑conducting wires.  ### Methods - **DFT calculations** using the PBE generalized‑gradient approximation, ultrasoft pseudopotentials, and a 35 Ry plane‑wave cutoff.  - **Slab model**: a four‑layer Pt(221) slab with an 18 Å vacuum; the two bottom layers are fixed. Tests show that adding extra Pt layers changes adsorption and dissociation energies by less than 0.02 eV, indicating that the chosen slab does not materially affect the electronic properties.  - **Systems studied**: isolated monomers, dimers, trimers, and periodic zig‑zag water chains containing up to twelve molecules.  - **Energetics**: adsorption energies, dissociation energies, and reaction barriers obtained; zero‑point energy (ZPE) corrections derived from harmonic vibrational analysis to capture nuclear quantum effects.  - **Transition states** located with the nudged‑elastic‑band (NEB) method.  - **Electronic analysis** via projected densities of states (pDOS) and d‑band centre shifts to elucidate O‑Pt covalent bonding versus hydrogen bonding.  ### Results - **Stronger binding at steps**: water binds 0.09–0.18 eV per molecule more strongly at step edges than on Pt(111).  - **Monomer**: exhibits a sizable dissociation barrier (~0.8 eV) and endothermic dissociation (ΔE ≈ +0.51 eV).  - **Clusters**: neighboring molecules lower the barrier to ~0.5 eV; dissociation becomes exothermic for trimers and larger clusters (ΔE ≈ 0 eV for dimers, ~‑0.12 eV for trimers after ZPE).  - **Periodic wires**: the most favorable dissociation ratio is 1 H₂O out of 4 (≈25 %). Without ZPE the per‑molecule dissociation energy is –0.025 eV; with ZPE it becomes –0.055 eV. The barrier remains ~0.5 eV, independent of dissociation concentration.  - **Autocatalysis**: intact neighbors destabilize the O–H bond of the donating molecule while strengthening O‑Pt interactions of the resulting OH, leading to the reduced barrier.  - **Nuclear quantum effects**: ZPE corrections (≈0.1–0.2 eV) consistently favor the dissociated state, chiefly because the high‑frequency OH stretch is replaced by a low‑frequency Pt–H mode.  - **Electronic structure**: dissociation broadens and hybridizes O p‑states with Pt d‑states, creating density at the Fermi level. The shift of the Pt d‑band centre (Δε_d) correlates strongly with O‑Pt distance and is independent of the water’s dissociation state, indicating that local O‑Pt bonding governs reactivity.  ### Conclusions - Water binds preferentially to step edges of Pt(221) and undergoes partial dissociation when coverage allows formation of trimers or larger clusters.  - Cooperative hydrogen bonding and O‑Pt covalent interactions together lower the dissociation barrier, making autocatalytic dissociation feasible on experimental timescales.  - For periodic wires, about one out of three to four water molecules dissociate, providing a high concentration of proton vacancies that could enable proton conduction along the chain.  - The findings have implications for catalysis and photo‑electrochemical cells, where stepped Pt surfaces may significantly alter water‑splitting thermodynamics and kinetics.  ### Limitations (revised) - **Dispersion effects**: The PBE functional underestimates absolute adsorption energies (by ~0.2 eV) due to the lack of explicit dispersion corrections, but this underestimation is systematic and does not significantly change relative energy differences between the examined structures, as reported by the authors.  - **Temperature and anharmonicity**: Simulations are performed at 0 K with harmonic ZPE estimates; anharmonic vibrational effects and full finite‑temperature dynamics are only briefly explored via short ab‑initio molecular‑dynamics snapshots.  - **Surface model**: While the slab uses a limited number of Pt layers, tests show that adding extra layers alters adsorption and dissociation energies by less than 0.02 eV, confirming that the chosen four‑layer slab with fixed bottom layers does not materially affect the electronic properties.  - **Environmental factors**: Co‑adsorbates (e.g., O₂, H₂) and external electric fields, common in realistic catalytic or electrochemical environments, are not included and could modify dissociation thermodynamics.  - **Kinetic analysis**: The rate estimate relies on simple transition‑state theory; more rigorous methods (e.g., metadynamics or kinetic Monte Carlo) would be needed for quantitative predictions under experimental conditions.  **Future work** should incorporate dispersion‑inclusive functionals, explicit temperature sampling, larger and more flexible surface models, and the effects of electric potentials and co‑adsorbates to fully assess the viability of stepped Pt as proton‑wire conduits in practical applications.

Calculations employed: - Geometry optimisation with the PBE functional; - Accurate electronic band structures using the HSE06 hybrid functional; - Real‑time TDDFT for optical and plasmonic responses.  **Structural and Dynamical Stability** - Cohesive energies are **‑4.498 eV/atom (HPSi)**, **‑4.751 eV/atom (HSiP)**, and **‑4.740 eV/atom (HSiPbp)**, indicating strong binding.  - Phonon dispersion curves show **no imaginary (soft) modes**, confirming kinetic stability of the three sheets in vacuum.  **Electronic Properties** - All three monolayers are **indirect‑gap semiconductors** with HSE06 band gaps of **2.74 eV (HPSi)**, **3.33 eV (HSiP)**, and **3.75 eV (HSiPbp)**.  - The valence‑band maximum (VBM) is dominated by Si *p* orbitals, while the conduction‑band minimum (CBM) is primarily P *p* character.  - Work‑function calculations place the CBM **above the H⁺/H₂ reduction potential (‑4.44 eV)** and the VBM **below the O₂/H₂O oxidation potential (‑5.67 eV)**, satisfying the thermodynamic criteria for overall water splitting.  **Strain Engineering** - Uniform biaxial strain from **‑10 % to +10 %** linearly tunes the band gaps over a range of roughly **1.2 eV** and shifts the absolute band‑edge positions.  - Within the strain window the structures remain mechanically stable, as reflected by the cohesive‑energy vs. strain curves.  **Optical and Plasmonic Response** - TDDFT‑derived absorption spectra exhibit strong resonances in the **visible window (1.7–3.3 eV)** for the periodic monolayers.  - Finite nanoribbons (27‑atom wide) show pronounced, edge‑dependent plasmonic peaks: e.g., HPSi peaks at 0.86, 1.51, 2.53 eV (armchair) and 0.58, 1.16, 1.98 eV (zigzag); HSiP and HSiPbp display similar low‑energy features.  - Polarisation‑sensitive absorption suggests potential for photodetection and solar‑energy conversion.  **Limitations Highlighted by the Review** 1. **Environmental Effects Not Considered** – All stability and electronic analyses are performed in vacuum; the impact of solvents, substrates, or ambient moisture on structural integrity and band alignment is absent.  2. **Redox Alignment Simplifications** – The band‑edge analysis ignores explicit pH dependence and possible surface dipole shifts arising from hydrogen termination, which could modify the effective redox potentials.  3. **Strain Model Assumptions** – The study assumes homogeneous biaxial strain, whereas realistic strain fields may be non‑uniform and could induce defects or phase transitions that are not captured by the harmonic phonon treatment.  4. **Excitonic Effects Omitted** – Optical spectra are obtained within the adiabatic TDDFT framework without many‑body GW/BSE corrections; strong excitonic binding typical of 2D semiconductors may alter the absorption onset and intensities.  5. **Synthetic Feasibility Unaddressed** – No experimental synthesis routes, kinetic pathways, or validation of the proposed hydrogenation patterns are provided, leaving their practical realisation uncertain.  **Suggested Future Directions** - Incorporate explicit solvent and substrate models (e.g., via continuum solvation or slab calculations) to assess environmental stability.  - Evaluate pH‑dependent redox potentials and surface dipole contributions to band‑edge positions.  - Study non‑uniform strain distributions, defect formation energies, and possible phase transformations under mechanical load.  - Apply GW and Bethe‑Salpeter Equation (BSE) methods to capture excitonic spectra and refine optical predictions.  - Pursue experimental synthesis (e.g., chemical vapor deposition, plasma‑enhanced hydrogenation) and characterisation to verify the predicted structures and functionalities.  **Conclusion** The work demonstrates that hydrogen‑saturated Si‑P monolayers are intrinsically stable 2D semiconductors with tunable indirect band gaps, favorable band‑edge alignments for photocatalytic water splitting, and promising visible‑light absorption and polarisation‑dependent plasmonic behaviour.  Addressing the outlined limitations will be essential for translating these theoretical insights into practical nano‑electronic, optoelectronic, and photocatalytic applications.  "

The system is designed to **optimize water‑quality monitoring** while substantially reducing the logistical burden of in‑situ sampling.  ## System Architecture - A hierarchical, GIS‑based framework consisting of **39 elements** organized into **8 management subsystems** and **31 functional modules**.  - The GIMS automatically generates **subject identifiers for each spatial pixel** (Δφ × Δλ grid) and stores them in a database together with anthropogenic scenarios, meteorological series, and hydrodynamic parameters.  - Core process‑based sub‑models include: - **WBM** – water‑balance model - **MCSO** – multi‑factor surface outflow model - **MTM** – chemical transformation model - **SEP** – lagoon‑sea exchange model (tidal forcing : VΓ(t)=VΓmax|cos[π(t‑tmax)/τ|) - Additional modules for energy‑matter flows, pollutant transport, and decision‑making.  ## Methodology 1. The lagoon is discretized into pixels; each pixel receives identifiers for physical, ecological, and socio‑economic attributes.  2. Coupled differential equations describe transport and transformation of **dissolved (ξ)** and **particulate (μ)** contaminants, including sediment‑water exchange processes.  3. Salinity dynamics are solved with a diffusion‑advection balance that incorporates tidal forcing.  4. **In‑situ measurements** were collected at **10 stations** (stratified by depth) for salinity, turbidity, pH, and PO₄³⁻ (PO4‑34). These data were used for model calibration and validation.  ## Key Results - Using data **only from site 1 (the lagoon‑sea strait)**, the model reconstructed spatial distributions with the following average errors (Table 4): - **Salinity:** 10.7 % - **Turbidity:** ≈11 % - **pH:** 6 % - **PO₄³⁻:** 15.4 % - Forecasts over a **two‑week horizon** achieved **84–90 % accuracy**.  - **Seasonal performance:** forecasts in the **dry season are about 9–10 % more accurate** than those in the wet season.  - Scenario analysis of tidal regulation showed that maintaining **sea‑water inflows of 300–500 m³ s⁻¹** keeps salinity within the ecologically optimal range of **22.5–24.5 ‰**; complete closure of the strait drives salinity below acceptable thresholds.  ## Limitations 1. Validation is based on a limited temporal window and only ten sampling sites, raising concerns about robustness under extreme hydrometeorological events.  2. Model coefficients in **MTM, SHP, and SEC** required ad‑hoc adjustment to fit anomalous observations at sites 3 and 7, indicating possible structural deficiencies in sediment‑water exchange representation.  3. The system relies heavily on accurate meteorological forecasts; errors are larger during the wet season (forecast errors >10 %).  4. Land‑use and pollutant source inventories are treated as static, ignoring dynamic agricultural practices and episodic industrial discharges.  5. Maintaining and updating the extensive GIMS database entails significant computational overhead, which may limit scalability to larger coastal basins.  ## Recommendations & Future Work - **Monitoring schedule:** conduct measurements at **site 1** every **three weeks in the dry season** and every **two weeks in the wet season** (as highlighted in the conclusions).  - **Future instrumentation:** plan to deploy an **adaptive spectro‑ellipsometric sensor** at the fixed strait location for real‑time water‑quality assessment and automated tidal‑regime management.  - Expand spatial and temporal density of field measurements, incorporate stochastic representations of climate and runoff uncertainties, refine sediment dynamics with mechanistic biogeochemical sub‑models, and test GIMS transferability to other lagoonal systems with different geomorphology and anthropogenic pressures."

The resulting surface‑tension curve follows the experimental values over the whole temperature range, improving on the rigid models which fit only part of the range.  - **Heat of vaporization** and the **liquid‑vapor coexistence curve** (including critical temperature and density) are reproduced with substantially reduced deviation compared with SPC/E, SPC/ǫ and SPC/Fw.  **Simulation details** - Molecular dynamics performed with **GROMACS 4.5.4**.  - **NPT** simulations for bulk properties: 500 water molecules, isotropic volume fluctuations, Nosé‑Hoover thermostat (τ_T=0.2 ps), Parrinello‑Rahman barostat (τ_P=0.5 ps), 1 fs timestep, LJ and real‑space electrostatics truncated at 9 Å, long‑range LJ corrections applied.  - **NVT** simulations for surface tension: 5832 molecules, same timestep, PME with grid spacing 1.2 Å, spline order 4, real‑space tolerance 10⁻⁶, cutoff 26 Å.  - Dielectric constant obtained from dipole‑moment fluctuations over ≥200 ns production runs (10 ns equilibration).  **Limitations explicitly noted by the authors** - The model is **non‑polarizable**; flexibility partially compensates for missing electronic response but does not replace explicit polarizability.  - Parameterization relies on a **limited set of bulk reference properties** (density, dielectric constant, dipole moment at a single state point, and melting temperature). Consequently, transferability to extreme conditions (very high pressure, deep supercooling, strong confinement) has not been demonstrated.  **Overall assessment** The Flexible Bond and Angle (FBA/ǫ) model successfully integrates harmonic bond‑length and angle flexibility into a three‑site, non‑polarizable water potential. By fitting to a small but carefully chosen experimental dataset, it reproduces a wide range of structural, thermodynamic, and phase‑behavior properties—including density, dielectric constant, compressibility minimum, surface tension, and melting temperature—with accuracy that surpasses several widely used rigid models. The authors conclude that, despite its non‑polarizable nature and the limited parametrization scope, the model’s robustness makes it a promising candidate for simulations of pure water and, potentially, of aqueous solutions."

            "summary": "Oberhofer and Reuter present a first‑principles thermodynamic screening protocol that extends the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) framework to explicitly include photo‑generated charge carriers. By treating the minimum hole energy (\\(\\varepsilon_{hole}\\)) required to make each elementary step of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) thermodynamically downhill as a descriptor, they can rapidly evaluate many catalyst/co‑catalyst combinations without full kinetic modeling.  The method is applied in two stages. First, free‑energy changes for the four‑step OER pathway (\\(* \\rightarrow OH^{*} \\rightarrow O^{*} \\rightarrow OOH^{*} \\rightarrow O_{2}\\)) are computed on a prototypical TiO₂(110) facet using hybrid‑level DFT (PBE0) together with experimentally derived proton solvation energies. This yields a required hole energy of about **‑7.5 eV** (relative to vacuum), which is more negative than the rutile TiO₂ valence‑band maximum (VBM, \\(\\varepsilon_{VBM}\\)≈‑7.1 eV), indicating that water oxidation is thermodynamically infeasible on a defect‑free TiO₂(110) surface.  In addition to the (110) facet, the authors evaluate three other TiO₂ facets and report both the hole energies needed to drive the OER and the corresponding surface‑trapped hole levels (\\(\\varepsilon_{T}\\)) that are available on those facets: - **Rutile (001):** \\(\\varepsilon_{hole} = -7.3\\) eV, \\(\\varepsilon_{T} = -6.4\\) eV - **Anatase (100):** \\(\\varepsilon_{hole} = -6.9\\) eV, \\(\\varepsilon_{T} = -6.6\\) eV - **Anatase (001):** \\(\\varepsilon_{hole} = -7.0\\) eV, \\(\\varepsilon_{T} = -5.8\\) eV Second, the same OER energetics are evaluated for a series of Au co‑catalysts: the extended Au(111) surface and 13 Au clusters containing 2–55 atoms. The computed hole energies range from **‑6.7 eV** for Au(111) to **‑5.6 eV** for the larger Au₂₀ and Au₅₅ clusters. By comparing these \\(\\varepsilon_{hole}\\) values with the TiO₂ surface‑trapped hole levels \\(\\varepsilon_{T}\\), the authors show that most Au clusters lie below (i.e., are less negative than) the TiO₂ thresholds, meaning that the photo‑generated holes on TiO₂ can thermodynamically drive water oxidation on these metal co‑catalysts.  The study therefore predicts that sub‑nanometer Au clusters can serve as effective OER co‑catalysts for TiO₂‑based photocatalysts, alleviating the energetic bottleneck imposed by the semiconductor’s VBM. The authors acknowledge three main limitations: (i) kinetic barriers are ignored, so thermodynamic feasibility does not guarantee activity; (ii) charge‑transfer and geometric relaxation at the catalyst–co‑catalyst interface are omitted, treating the hole as a static external potential; and (iii) absolute band‑edge alignments are taken from literature values with considerable spread, and \\(\\varepsilon_{T}\\) has not been computed for every facet. Future work should incorporate explicit kinetic modeling, realistic interfacial charge redistribution, and many‑body perturbation methods to refine band‑edge positions for a more comprehensive assessment of viable photo‑catalyst/co‑catalyst ensembles."

            "summary": "### Summary of *Graph Neural Networks for Pressure Estimation in Water Distribution Systems* (Truong et al., 2023) **Goal and novelty** - The paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines EPANET‑based physics simulations with a graph‑neural‑network (GNN) surrogate to estimate nodal pressures in water distribution networks (WDNs) from highly sparse measurements.  - Three technical contributions are introduced: 1. **Data‑generation pipeline** – dynamic parameters (reservoir heads, junction demands, pump speeds, valve settings, pipe roughness) are sampled independently from uniform distributions while *no* time‑dependent demand patterns are used. This yields a diverse set of synthetic snapshots.  2. **Random‑masking training** – at each training epoch a new random mask keeps only 5 % of nodes observable (the rest are set to zero). The model therefore learns to reconstruct pressures under arbitrary sensor placements.  3. **Realistic evaluation protocol** – test data are generated with real‑world time‑varying demand patterns and Gaussian noise injected into the demands, creating out‑of‑distribution (OOD) conditions.  - A **multi‑graph pre‑training** strategy is also explored: the GNN is first trained on several benchmark topologies and then either applied zero‑shot to an unseen network or fine‑tuned on the target network.  **Model architecture (GATRes)** - The water network is represented as an undirected graph \\(G = (X, A, E)\\) where \\(X\\) holds pressure (single‑channel node feature), \\(A\\) is the adjacency matrix and \\(E\\) may contain pipe length and diameter.  - A *GATRes* block consists of two successive Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers with multi‑head attention, a mean aggregation after the second GAT, and a residual skip connection that adds the block input to its output. Stacking several blocks allows information to propagate over many hops while the residual connection mitigates over‑smoothing.  - The overall network uses a linear “stem” layer to lift the masked input to a higher dimension, several GATRes blocks, and a final linear decoder that maps back to a single pressure value per node.  - Training minimizes mean‑squared error (MSE) on the masked nodes using the Adam optimizer; early stopping is applied based on validation loss.  **Key quantitative results** | Dataset / setting | MAE (m H₂O) | MAPE | NSE | Acc@0.1 m H₂O | Throughput (snapshots / s) | |-------------------|------------|------|-----|--------------|-----------------------------| | **Oosterbeek – clean test** (95 % mask) | **1.937 ± 0.007** | **0.0703 ± 0.0005** | **0.7773 ± 0.0025** | **0.8746 ≈ 87.5 %** | **749.38** | | Oosterbeek – noisy test (Gaussian demand noise, 95 % mask) | 1.964 ± 0.030 | 0.0802 ± 0.0458 | 0.778 ± 0.011 | 0.8656 ≈ 86.6 % | – | | **Baseline comparisons (clean test)** | | | | | | | GCNii | 6.357 | 0.2147 | –0.0137 | 0.3848 | 663.80 | | GAT | 3.726 | 0.1287 | 0.3276 | 0.7352 | 2320.37 | | GraphConvWat (tuned) | 2.293 | 0.0821 | 0.7518 | 0.8303 | 2026.65 | | mGCN | 2.111 | 0.0806 | 0.7100 | 0.8405 | 44.94 | | **GATRes‑large** (1.67 M params) | 2.020 | 0.0711 | 0.7864 | 0.8433 | 31.21 | | **GATRes‑small** (0.66 M params) – best overall | 1.937 | 0.0703 | 0.7773 | 0.8746 | 749.38 | | **Multi‑graph zero‑shot** (trained on L‑Town, Ky13, Large) | 3.0597 ± 0.0074 | 0.0998 ± 0.0005 | 0.5700 ± 0.0045 | – | – | | **Fine‑tuned** (pre‑trained then trained on Oosterbeek) | 1.9097 ± 0.0076 | 0.0695 ± 0.0005 | 0.7980 ± 0.0030 | – | – | **Masking‑ratio robustness** - The model was evaluated with masking rates from 20 % up to 99 % (i.e., only 1 % of nodes observed). Results (MAE / MAPE) are: - 20 %: 0.610 / 0.0265 - 50 %: 0.798 / 0.0286 - 70 %: 0.900 / 0.0331 - 90 %: 1.457 / 0.0544 - 95 %: 1.939 / 0.0703 - 96 %: 2.213 / 0.0800 - 97 %: 2.415 / 0.0867 - 98 %: 3.075 / 0.1091 - 99 %: **4.087 / 0.1414** (14.14 % MAPE) - Accuracy at the 0.1 m H₂O threshold declines from 0.976 at 20 % masking to 0.640 at 99 % masking, confirming graceful degradation.  **Ablation study** (C‑Town, 24‑h test) - Removing the **residual connection** caused the largest performance loss: MAE increased from 9.486 mH₂O (full model) to **11.536 mH₂O**, MAPE rose from 0.069 % to 0.0815 %, and NSE dropped from 0.848 to 0.769.  - Omitting the mean aggregation or moving it outside the block also worsened results, but the drop was smaller than that caused by removing the residual link.  - These findings confirm that the residual skip connection is crucial for preserving useful node representations across deep GATRes stacks.  **General observations** - The hybrid pipeline successfully bridges physics‑based simulation (for data synthesis) and data‑driven GNN inference, achieving state‑of‑the‑art pressure reconstruction on a large Dutch network (Oosterbeek) and on several public benchmarks (C‑Town, L‑Town, Richmond, Anytown).  - GATRes‑small provides the best trade‑off between accuracy, inference speed, and model size.  - Multi‑graph pre‑training enables zero‑shot inference on unseen topologies (MAE ≈ 3.06 m H₂O) and, after fine‑tuning, yields a modest further improvement over training from scratch (MAE ≈ 1.91 m H₂O, MAPE ≈ 6.95 %).  - The random‑masking training strategy makes the model robust to sensor relocation without retraining.  - Limitations noted by the authors include residual over‑smoothing for larger models and the need for richer uncertainty modeling beyond Gaussian noise.  **Conclusion** Truong et al. demonstrate that a carefully designed GNN (GATRes), trained on a diverse set of synthetic snapshots and evaluated with realistic OOD test data, can estimate nodal pressures in WDNs with MAE ≈ 1.9 m H₂O and MAPE ≈ 7 % while remaining computationally efficient (≈ 750 snapshots / s). The work also opens the path toward generalizable, pre‑trained surrogate models for water‑network digital twins."

            "summary": "In the European EMRP project MeteoMet, Buée et al. describe a fully vacuum‑operated bench for the preparation of copper cells used in high‑accuracy determinations of the water vapour pressure equation (WVPE) and the triple point of water (TPW). The bench incorporates a continuous bidistiller that supplies water from a reverse‑osmosis plant, a two‑stage outgassing system consisting of two 1 L borosilicate glass flasks (Flask 1 and Flask 2) equipped with heating mantles, and a copper‑cell handling assembly. All connections are made with glass tubes and silicone‑tube valves that can be clamped to act as closed valves, minimizing contamination from conventional metal or glass valves. The copper cells are fabricated from Oxygen‑Free High Conductivity (OFHC) copper and sealed by electron‑beam welding to avoid introducing impurities.  **Procedural phases** 1. **Bench cleaning** – The system is evacuated with primary pumps to ~20 mbar, flushed with at least 9 L of bidistilled water, and the water in the flasks is heated close to its boiling point while being pumped to degas dissolved gases, replacing the bench atmosphere with water vapour. The water level is restored in Flask 2 by transferring outgassed water from Flask 1 under vacuum.  2. **Flask filling** – Fresh bidistilled water is introduced into Flask 1 under vacuum (valve VB0 closed), degassed by heating under pumping, and then transferred to Flask 2 by heating Flask 1 to raise its pressure while the appropriate valves are opened. This step can be repeated as needed to maintain water volume.  3. **Cell cleaning** – The copper cell is heated on a plate at about 60 °C for more than six hours under vacuum to degas the metal. It is then rinsed repeatedly with the degassed water from the flasks, and finally drained so that only steam remains inside. Steps of heating, rinsing, and draining are performed at least twice.  4. **Cell filling** – Water is distilled from Flask 2 into a graduated borosilicate pipette cooled to condense the vapor. The water in the pipette is subsequently evaporated and condensed into the cooled copper cell. The graduated pipette provides a measure of the water volume introduced, and once the desired amount is delivered the inlet and outlet tubes are sealed permanently by pinching‑off.  **Conclusion** – The bench developed at LNE‑CNAM enables the filling of copper cells for WVPE and TPW measurements with high‑purity water. Validation of the system and the procedure is ongoing; measurements on recently filled prototypes are being performed to assess impurity levels, and results will be reported in forthcoming publications.

            "paper_id": "A new class of photo-catalytic materials and a novel principle for efficient water splitting under infrared and visible light - MgB2 as unexpected example.pdf",
            "summary": "Kravets and Grigorenko propose a new class of stable photocatalytic materials—ionic or covalent binary metals with layered, graphite‑like structures—and present a corresponding principle for solar‑driven water splitting that utilizes infrared (IR) and visible photons.  They note that conventional photocatalysts, typically wide‑bandgap semiconductors, are reported to have limited absorption in the IR/visible range and to suffer rapid charge‑carrier recombination.  The authors identify magnesium diboride (MgB₂) as an unexpected example of such a layered binary metal that meets four functional criteria: (1) strong absorption of IR and visible light, (2) internal electric fields near alternating layers that can separate generated ions, (3) provision of ion‑trapping sites of both polarities within the layered structure, and (4) the ability to deliver electrons and holes needed for hydrogen and oxygen evolution.  Experimental work combining optical spectroscopy, electrochemical measurements, and gas‑evolution analysis shows a photocurrent that corresponds to an apparent conversion efficiency of about 27 % when a modest external bias of 0.5 V is applied.  Spectral measurements reveal significant absorption extending from the visible into the near‑IR, consistent with the material’s metallic electronic structure.  The proposed mechanism suggests that photo‑excited carriers in the metallic layers drift under the intrinsic fields at the Mg–B interfaces, driving the reduction of water to H₂ and the oxidation to O₂, although the source does not assign the specific redox reactions to particular layers.  The authors compare MgB₂ with established photocatalysts such as TiO₂ and CdS, highlighting its broader light‑harvesting range, chemical stability in aqueous environments, and operation with a relatively low external bias.  The paper also discusses several limitations: the reported efficiency relies on the external 0.5 V bias, the experiments were performed on bulk MgB₂ pellets (with no discussion of nanostructured or thin‑film scalability), long‑term stability under continuous illumination is only qualitatively mentioned, direct experimental evidence for the internal‑field‑driven charge separation is lacking, and the influence of electrolyte composition, pH, or side reactions was not explored.  The authors suggest that future work should address bias‑free operation, nanoscale engineering of the layered architecture, systematic durability testing, and in‑situ probing of charge‑separation dynamics to further evaluate binary layered metals as viable photocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production."

            "summary": "The article by S. Amos, J. L. Gross, and M. Thoennessen presents a systematic compilation of the first refereed reports documenting the discovery of isotopes of calcium (24 isotopes), indium (38 isotopes), tin (38 isotopes), and platinum (39 isotopes). Its primary aim is to give the nuclear‑physics community a definitive, chronologically ordered reference that details the production and identification methods for each isotope, thereby clarifying priority claims that have accumulated over many years of experimental work.  For every isotope the authors provide a concise synopsis of the seminal publication. Each entry lists the laboratory where the work was performed, the accelerator configuration, the target‑projectile combination, and the key observables that secured the isotope’s assignment. The detection techniques mentioned include mass spectroscopy, β‑decay spectroscopy, γ‑ray spectroscopy, and implantation‑decay correlation.  Methodologically, the authors performed an exhaustive literature survey of peer‑reviewed articles up to September 2010. They cross‑checked discovery claims against the published record and compiled the information into a single catalogue. The paper therefore transforms a scattered body of literature into an accessible database suitable for inclusion in the *Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables*.  The authors acknowledge several limitations. The reliance on published, refereed sources excludes gray literature, internal reports, and unpublished data that may have contributed to earlier observations, which could bias the historical record toward well‑funded laboratories. The brief synopses, by design, omit detailed experimental uncertainties, calibration procedures, and later re‑evaluations that have sometimes led to reassignment of mass numbers. The work is purely descriptive; it does not provide a quantitative analysis of discovery trends, production cross‑section systematics, or discuss the theoretical implications of the newly accessed regions of the nuclear chart. Finally, the scope is limited to the four elements calcium, indium, tin, and platinum, and does not extend to the full chart of nuclides.  "

    "final_summary_my_pipe": "Final Summary: ## Integrated Summary of Recent Water‑Related Research ### 1. Surface Microlenses for Solar‑Driven Photodegradation (Lu et al., 2022) - **Fabrication & optics**: Polymer microlenses (MLs) are created by solvent‑exchange nucleation of methyl‑methacrylate (MMA) nanodroplets on octadecyltrichlorosilane‑treated glass, followed by UV‑curing to poly(methyl methacrylate). Flow‑rate during exchange (30–90 mL h⁻¹) controls droplet size, surface coverage and curvature. Two routes are explored: 1. **Random MLs** on a homogeneous hydrophobic substrate.  2. **Ordered ML arrays** on a pre‑patterned substrate (5 µm hydrophobic domains spaced 10 µm) produced with one or two solvent‑exchange rounds (ML array 1, ML array 2).  - **Optical performance**: All ML‑decorated glasses transmit **>97 % of visible light**. Arrayed lenses exhibit focal intensities up to **five orders of magnitude** higher than the incident beam.  - **Photodegradation results**: - Random MLs fabricated at **70 mL h⁻¹** increase methyl‑orange (MO) degradation efficiency (η) by **186 %** versus bare glass.  - A linear correlation is observed between η and the summed focal intensities for random lenses.  - Ordered arrays show a **~100 % regional effect**: ML array 1 gives a **471 %** η boost, ML array 2 a **607 %** boost, far exceeding random lenses with the same summed intensity.  - Bottle‑proof‑of‑concept tests (4 h simulated solar light) improve degradation rates of three antibiotics by **30 % (NFX), 160 % (SFD) and 90 % (SMZ)**.  - Under indoor sunlight, ML‑functionalized bottles display a **9–23×** enhancement in MO degradation after **9–12 days**; larger MLs (vials 2/3) outperform the smallest (vial 1).  - **Practical notes**: Precise ML size and curvature rely on **flow‑rate control**; the authors stress the need for validation under **natural sunlight** before large‑scale deployment.  ### 2. Autocatalytic Water Dissociation on Stepped Pt(221) (Donadio, Ghiringhelli & Delle Site) - **Computational details**: The authors employed density‑functional theory with the **PBE generalized‑gradient functional**, **ultrasoft pseudopotentials**, a **35 Ry plane‑wave cutoff**, and a **four‑layer Pt(221) slab** (bottom two layers fixed). This setup was used to compute adsorption and dissociation energetics.  - **Binding energetics**: Water binds **0.09–0.18 eV per molecule stronger** at step edges than on Pt(111).  - **Monomer dissociation**: Barrier ≈ **0.8 eV**; reaction is **endothermic (+0.51 eV)**.  - **Cluster effects**: Neighboring molecules lower the barrier to **≈0.5 eV**; dissociation becomes **exothermic for trimers** (ΔE ≈ 0 eV without ZPE, –0.12 eV with ZPE). Periodic wires favour a **≈25 % dissociation ratio** (1 H₂O per 4 molecules). ZPE corrections (≈0.1–0.2 eV) consistently **favor the dissociated state**.  - **Electronic‑structure insights**: Projected DOS shows **hybridisation of O p‑states with Pt d‑states** upon dissociation; the **d‑band‑centre shift** correlates strongly with O‑Pt distance and is independent of the water’s dissociation state, indicating that local O‑Pt bonding governs reactivity.  ### 3. Hydrogen‑Saturated Si‑P Monolayers (Shu et al.) - **Thermodynamic stability**: Cohesive energies are **‑4.498 eV/atom (HPSi)**, **‑4.751 eV/atom (HSiP)** and **‑4.740 eV/atom (HSiPbp)**; phonon spectra show **no imaginary modes**.  - **Electronic properties**: - Indirect HSE06 band gaps: **2.74 eV (HPSi)**, **3.33 eV (HSiP)**, **3.75 eV (HSiPbp)**.  - **Work‑function alignment** places the CBM **above –4.44 eV** (H⁺/H₂) and the VBM **below –5.67 eV** (O₂/H₂O), satisfying overall water‑splitting redox criteria.  - **Strain engineering**: Uniform biaxial strain from **‑10 % to +10 %** tunes the band gap by **≈1.2 eV** while preserving mechanical stability.  - **Optical response**: Real‑time TDDFT gives strong absorption peaks in the **visible window (1.7–3.3 eV)**.  - **Plasmonic nanoribbons**: Finite‑width ribbons display edge‑dependent plasmonic resonances, e.g., HPSi armchair ribbons at **0.86, 1.51, 2.53 eV** and zig‑zag at **0.58, 1.16, 1.98 eV**; analogous features appear for HSiP and HSiPbp.  - **Limitations**: Calculations are performed in vacuum, neglect solvent/environment effects; strain is assumed homogeneous; excitonic effects are not treated with GW/BSE.  ### 4. Geo‑Ecological Information‑Modeling System for Nuoc Ngot Lagoon (Krapivin, Varotsos & Nghia) - **Model architecture**: GIS‑based hierarchy of **39 elements** (8 management subsystems, 31 functional modules) storing spatial identifiers, anthropogenic scenarios, meteorology and hydrodynamics for each pixel.  - **Calibration & validation**: Only **10 in‑situ stations** were used. Using data from **site 1 alone**, the model reproduced: - **Salinity** error **10.7 %** - **Turbidity** error **≈11 %** - **pH** error **6 %** - **PO₄³⁻** error **15.4 %** - **Forecast skill**: Two‑week forecasts achieved **84–90 % accuracy**; dry‑season forecasts are **9–10 %** more accurate than wet‑season ones.  - **Scenario analysis**: Maintaining sea‑water inflow of **300–500 m³ s⁻¹** keeps salinity within the ecological window **22.5–24.5 ‰**; complete closure drives salinity below acceptable levels.  - **Limitations**: Reliance on a **small sensor network**, ad‑hoc coefficient tuning for anomalous sites, and strong dependence on **meteorological forecasts** (larger errors in wet season).  ### 5. Flexible Bond and Angle (FBA/ε) Water Model (Fuentes‑Azcatl & Barbosa, 2018) - **Simulation settings**: All molecular‑dynamics runs were performed with **GROMACS 4.5.4**. Bulk‑property NPT simulations used **500 water molecules**, a **Nosé‑Hoover thermostat** (τ_T = 0.2 ps), a **Parrinello‑Rahman barostat** (τ_P = 0.5 ps), a **1 fs timestep**, Lennard‑Jones cutoff **9 Å**, and PME for electrostatics (real‑space cutoff 9 Å, long‑range LJ corrections). Surface‑tension NVT simulations employed **5 832 molecules**, the same timestep, a **26 Å cutoff**, and PME with a grid spacing of 1.2 Å.  - **Thermodynamic performance**: The model reproduces density (240 K–450 K), dielectric constant (ε ≈ 78.5 at 298 K), melting temperature (≈ 243 K), isothermal compressibility minimum, thermal‑expansion coefficient, heat of vaporisation, and the full liquid‑vapor coexistence curve, outperforming several rigid three‑site models.  - **Limitations**: The model is **non‑polarizable** and was parametrised only against a limited bulk dataset (density, dielectric constant, dipole moment at a single state point and melting temperature). Transferability to extreme pressures, deep super‑cooling or confinement has not been demonstrated.  ### 6. Thermodynamic Screening of TiO₂‑Based OER Photocatalysts (Oberhofer & Reuter) - **Descriptor methodology**: The hole‑energy descriptor (minimum hole energy ε_hole required to make every OER step downhill) was derived within an **extended computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) framework** using **hybrid PBE0 DFT** and **experimentally calibrated proton solvation energies**.  - **Key results** (relative to vacuum): - TiO₂(110): **‑7.5 eV** (more negative than the VBM ≈‑7.1 eV → thermodynamically infeasible).  - Rutile (001): **‑7.3 eV**, surface‑trapped hole level **ε_T = ‑6.4 eV**.  - Anatase (100): **‑6.9 eV**, **ε_T = ‑6.6 eV**.  - Anatase (001): **‑7.0 eV**, **ε_T = ‑5.8 eV**.  - **Au co‑catalysts**: Hole‑energy requirements range from **‑6.7 eV (Au(111))** to **‑5.6 eV** for Au₂₀ and Au₅₅ clusters, i.e., below the TiO₂ surface‑trapped hole levels, making them viable OER co‑catalysts.  - **Acknowledged limitations**: (i) kinetic barriers are ignored; (ii) interface charge‑transfer and geometric relaxation are not modelled (holes treated as static external potentials); (iii) absolute band‑edge positions are taken from literature with considerable uncertainty.  ### 7. Graph‑Neural‑Network Surrogate for Water‑Distribution‑System Pressure Estimation (Truong et al., 2023) - **Model architecture (GATRes block)**: Each block consists of **two successive Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers** with **multi‑head attention**, followed by **mean aggregation** of the second GAT output and a **residual skip connection** that adds the block input to its output. Stacking several blocks enables deep message passing while the residual link mitigates over‑smoothing.  - **Training strategy**: **Random‑masking** is applied each epoch, retaining only **5 % of nodes** as observable and setting the rest to zero. This forces the network to learn reconstruction from highly sparse measurements.  - **Mask‑robustness (MAE / MAPE)**: - 20 % mask: 0.610 / 0.0265 - 50 % mask: 0.798 / 0.0286 - 70 % mask: 0.900 / 0.0331 - 90 % mask: 1.457 / 0.0544 - 95 % mask: **1.937 / 0.0703** (baseline) - 96 % mask: 2.213 / 0.0800 - 97 % mask: 2.415 / 0.0867 - 98 % mask: 3.075 / 0.1091 - 99 % mask: **4.087 / 0.1414** - **Ablation study**: Removing the **residual skip connection** increased MAE from 9.486 mH₂O to **11.536 mH₂O**, raised MAPE from 0.069 % to 0.0815 %, and dropped NSE from 0.848 to 0.769, confirming the residual link’s importance.  - **Transfer learning**: Zero‑shot inference on an unseen topology yielded **MAE ≈ 3.06 mH₂O**; fine‑tuning on the target network improved to **MAE ≈ 1.91 mH₂O** (MAPE ≈ 6.95 %). Larger models suffered from **over‑smoothing**, limiting further gains.  ### 8. Vacuum‑Operated Bench for High‑Purity Copper Cells (Buée et al.) The procedure consists of four sequential phases: 1. **Bench cleaning** – evacuation to ~20 mbar, water flush, heating‑under‑vacuum degassing of the two flasks, and restoration of the water level in Flask 2.  2. **Flask filling** – introduction of fresh bidistilled water into Flask 1 under vacuum, degassing, then pressure‑driven transfer to Flask 2; repeat as needed.  3. **Cell cleaning** – prolonged heating (~60 °C, >6 h) of the copper cell under vacuum, repeated rinsing with degassed water, and final draining to leave only steam.  4. **Cell filling** – distillation of water from Flask 2 into a cooled graduated pipette, evaporation into the cooled copper cell, volume measured by the pipette, followed by permanent sealing of inlet/outlet tubes.  This workflow aims to eliminate contamination for water‑vapour‑pressure‑equation and triple‑point‑of‑water metrology.  ### 9. MgB₂ as a Broadband Photocatalyst (Kravets & Grigorenko) - **Performance**: Bulk MgB₂ pellets deliver an apparent **27 % conversion efficiency** under simulated illumination with an external bias of **0.5 V**.  - **Mechanistic claim**: Strong visible/near‑IR absorption, intrinsic alternating Mg–B electric fields, and dual‑polarity ion‑trapping sites are proposed to separate photo‑excited carriers and drive H₂ evolution and O₂ oxidation.  - **Limitations**: (i) efficiency relies on the applied bias; (ii) experiments performed on **bulk pellets** – scalability to nanostructures or thin films is untested; (iii) **long‑term stability** under continuous illumination is only qualitatively mentioned; (iv) **direct evidence** for the internal‑field‑driven charge separation is lacking; (v) the influence of **electrolyte composition, pH, or side reactions** has not been explored.  ### 10. First Refereed Discoveries of Ca, In, Sn & Pt Isotopes (Amos, Gross & Thoennessen) - **Scope**: Chronological catalogue of 24 Ca, 38 In, 38 Sn and 39 Pt isotopes, each entry listing laboratory, accelerator, target‑projectile combination and detection technique (mass spectroscopy, β/γ spectroscopy, implantation‑decay correlation).  - **Limitations**: The work **excludes gray‑literature and unpublished reports**, omits detailed experimental uncertainties and calibration procedures, and provides only a **descriptive database** without quantitative trend analysis (e.g., production cross‑section systematics). Consequently, it serves as a reference for priority but not for deeper statistical insight.  "
