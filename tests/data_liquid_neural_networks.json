The essential idea of the proof is to embed the n-dimensional dynamical system into a higher dimensional one which defines a recurrent neural network. As a corollary, we also show that any continuous curve can be approximated by the output of a recurrent neural network."

            "summary": "Dynamical neural networks are being increasingly employed in a variety of contexts, including as simple model nervous systems for autonomous agents. For this reason, there is a growing need for a comprehensive understanding of their dynamical properties. Using a combination of elementary analysis and numerical studies, this article begins a systematic examination of the dynamics of continuous-time recurrent neural networks. Specifically, a fairly complete description of the possible dynamical behavior and bifurcations of one- and two-neuron circuits is given, along with a few specific results for larger networks. This analysis provides both qualitative insight and, in many cases, quantitative formulas for predicting the dynamical behavior of particular circuits and how that behavior changes as network parameters are varied. These results demonstrate that even small circuits are capable of a rich variety of dynamical behavior (including chaotic dynamics). An approach to understanding the dynamics of circuits with time-varying inputs is also presented. Finally, based on this analysis, several strategies for focusing evolutionary searches into fruitful regions of network parameter space are suggested."

            "summary": "A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology."

How are these two forms of activity related? We develop a procedure called FORCE learning for modifying synaptic strengths either external to or within a model neural network to change chaotic spontaneous activity into a wide variety of desired activity patterns. FORCE learning works even though the networks we train are spontaneously chaotic and we leave feedback loops intact and unclamped during learning. Using this approach, we construct networks that produce a wide variety of complex output patterns, input-output transformations that require memory, multiple outputs that can be switched by control inputs, and motor patterns matching human motion capture data. Our results reproduce data on premovement activity in motor and premotor cortex, and suggest that synaptic plasticity may be a more rapid and powerful modulator of network activity than generally appreciated."

These models are typically represented by continuous differential equations. However, their expressive power when they are deployed on computers is bottlenecked by numerical differential equation solvers. This limitation has notably slowed down the scaling and understanding of numerous natural physical phenomena such as the dynamics of nervous systems. Ideally, we would circumvent this bottleneck by solving the given dynamical system in closed form. This is known to be intractable in general. Here, we show that it is possible to closely approximate the interaction between neurons and synapses—the building blocks of natural and artificial neural networks—constructed by liquid time-constant networks efficiently in closed form. To this end, we compute a tightly bounded approximation of the solution of an integral appearing in liquid time-constant dynamics that has had no known closed-form solution so far. This closed-form solution impacts the design of continuous-time and continuous-depth neural models. For instance, since time appears explicitly in closed form, the formulation relaxes the need for complex numerical solvers. Consequently, we obtain models that are between one and five orders of magnitude faster in training and inference compared with differential equation-based counterparts. More importantly, in contrast to ordinary differential equation-based continuous networks, closed-form networks can scale remarkably well compared with other deep learning instances. Lastly, as these models are derived from liquid networks, they show good performance in time-series modelling compared with advanced recurrent neural network models."

    "final_summary_gpt": "## Summary Continuous-time signal processing requires models that can naturally represent evolving dynamical systems without relying on fixed discrete sampling assumptions. Early theoretical work established that continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) possess universal approximation capabilities for dynamical systems, providing a rigorous foundation for neural modeling of temporal signals [1]. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that even low-dimensional continuous-time networks can generate rich attractor dynamics suitable for adaptive behavior and signal transformation [2]. Parallel developments in reservoir computing further highlighted the computational power of continuous-time recurrent dynamics: liquid state machines showed that randomly connected dynamical systems can separate temporal inputs in high-dimensional state space [3], while echo state networks demonstrated accurate prediction of chaotic signals using fixed recurrent cores with trained readouts [4]. These findings were extended with biologically inspired training approaches such as FORCE learning, enabling stable generation and tracking of complex temporal patterns in recurrent networks [5]. Collectively, these studies confirmed that continuous-time neural dynamics offer strong representational capacity for nonlinear signal processing tasks, including prediction, filtering, and system identification.  Building on this dynamical systems perspective, modern neural differential equation frameworks formalize deep learning models directly in continuous time. Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterize state evolution via learned vector fields, enabling adaptive computation and memory-efficient training while maintaining competitive performance on time-series benchmarks [6]. Extensions such as ODE-RNN architectures integrate discrete observations with continuous latent flows to handle irregularly sampled signals [7], and neural controlled differential equations provide a mathematically grounded framework for learning from streaming data paths [8]. Within this broader class, liquid time-constant networks introduce state- and input-dependent time constants that modulate neuronal dynamics, yielding provably bounded trajectories and improved expressivity over fixed-time constant models in temporal prediction tasks [9]. Recent work on closed-form continuous-time neural networks further derived analytically tractable liquid dynamics, reducing computational overhead while preserving the stability and adaptability of continuous-time formulations [10]. Empirical evaluations across time-series classification, autonomous control, and nonlinear system modeling demonstrate that such liquid architectures maintain robustness to variable sampling rates and long-range dependencies without requiring explicit discretization heuristics [9,10]. Taken together, evidence from dynamical systems theory, reservoir computing, and neural differential equation research converges to support liquid neural networks as a principled and computationally viable framework for continuous-time signal processing.

The paper first identifies several motivating factors: (1) standard DSP           │ │  textbooks are heavily theory‑oriented and provide few practical applications; (2) students often lack starter code  │ │  and the \"tricks\" needed to solve homework problems; (3) learning is guided by a set of \"threshold concepts\"     │ │  that must be mastered for deeper understanding; and (4) a historical shift has occurred from a lecture‑centric      │ │  style based on the Oppenheim‑Schafer text to a more interactive, blended approach.\n\nThe proposed pedagogy         │ │  interleaves three components. **Partial flipping** requires students to review concise readings or short videos     │ │  before class, freeing in‑class time for application‑focused activities. **Active learning** is realized through     │ │  group‑based short quizzes, collaborative programming tasks, and guided derivations that emphasize intuition before  │ │  formal proof—for example, students explore FFT properties using a tabular exercise (Table I) and immediately        │ │  verify results with MATLAB scripts. **Visualization and hands‑on programming** are embedded throughout the course:  │ │  students record and filter their own speech, experiment with audio compression by truncating spectral components,   │ │  and analyze physiological signals such as photoplethysmogram (PPG) and intracranial EEG to compute heart‑rate or    │ │  seizure‑detection features. All MATLAB source code and data sets are provided as supplementary material to          │ │  facilitate replication.\n\nTo assess the approach, Parhi tracks attendance, quiz scores, and homework completion    │ │  across multiple semesters. The reported data show modest improvements in class participation and higher average     │ │  quiz performance relative to the earlier, more lecture‑centric implementation. Student surveys collected in the     │ │  course indicate a perception of increased relevance of DSP material and greater confidence in applying theoretical  │ │  concepts to real‑world data, although detailed statistical analyses are not presented.\n\nThe study acknowledges    │ │  several limitations. Reliance on MATLAB may restrict adoption at institutions lacking licenses or preferring        │ │  open‑source tools such as Python. The interventions demand substantial instructor preparation of custom problem     │ │  sets, starter codes, and audio/physiological datasets, which may be challenging for faculty with heavy teaching     │ │  loads. Evaluation metrics focus on short‑term engagement and performance, providing limited insight into long‑term  │ │  retention or transfer to industry contexts. Moreover, the absence of a randomized control group and possible        │ │  self‑selection of motivated students could bias the observed outcomes.\n\nFuture work is suggested to include       │ │  cross‑institutional trials, integration of diverse programming environments, and longitudinal studies that examine  │ │  the durability of learning gains and their impact on professional practice."

            "summary": "## Summary\n\n**Liquid Time‑constant Recurrent Neural Networks (LTC‑RNNs)**\n\nHasani et al.          │ │  introduce LTC‑RNNs, a subclass of continuous‑time recurrent neural networks in which each neuron’s time‑constant    │ │  is not fixed but varies dynamically with the membrane potentials of its presynaptic partners.  The variation is     │ │  realized through **sigmoidal chemical‑synapse models** (parameterized by a gain \\(\\gamma_{ij}\\) and a bias       │ │  \\(\\mu_{ij}\\)) and through linear gap‑junction (electrical‑synapse) couplings.  This biologically‑inspired        │ │  formulation yields a system of ordinary differential equations where the effective time‑constant of neuron *i* is   │ │  a function of the presynaptic states, thereby enhancing the expressive power of the network while keeping the       │ │  dynamics tractable.\n\n**Theoretical contribution**\n\nThe authors prove a *universal approximation theorem* for    │ │  LTC‑RNNs (Theorem 1).  Extending the argument of Funahashi and Nakamura (1993), they show that for any compact      │ │  subset \\(D\\) of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and any autonomous vector field \\(F:\\,D\\to\\mathbb{R}^n\\), there exists   │ │  an LTC‑RNN with a finite number of hidden (interneuron) units and \\(n\\) output (motor) units whose internal       │ │  state trajectory approximates any finite trajectory of the target dynamical system arbitrarily closely.  The proof  │ │  proceeds in three parts:\n1. **Feed‑forward approximation** of the target vector field using standard               │ │  universal‑approximation results for static networks.\n2. **Embedding** of this approximation into a                 │ │  continuous‑time system whose overall time‑constant \\(\\tau_{\\text{sys}}\\) is chosen sufficiently large to        │ │  guarantee stability.\n3. **Bounding** of the resulting LTC‑RNN dynamics within a compact region of                  │ │  state‑space.\n\nTwo lemmas underpin the analysis:\n- **Lemma 2** establishes explicit lower and upper bounds on     │ │  each neuron’s time‑constant \\(\\tau_i\\) in terms of the leak conductance, synaptic weights, and gap‑junction      │ │  conductances.\n- **Lemma 3** provides bounds on the neuronal membrane potentials, showing that they remain within   │ │  biologically plausible intervals determined by the leak reversal potentials and synaptic reversal                   │ │  potentials.\n\n**Empirical validation**\n\nThe paper evaluates LTC‑RNNs on several benchmark dynamical‑system       │ │  tasks, demonstrating that a modest number of hidden units can reproduce complex trajectories that would otherwise   │ │  require larger or deeper fixed‑time‑constant CTRNNs.  Additionally, LTC‑RNN controllers are deployed in             │ │  reinforcement‑learning environments for robotic locomotion, illustrating the model’s ability to adapt online and    │ │  to process temporal information efficiently.\n\n**Limitations and open questions**\n\n- The                         │ │  universal‑approximation proof assumes exact knowledge of the target vector field on a compact domain and relies on  │ │  Lipschitz continuity; learning such a field from noisy data may violate these assumptions.\n- The variable          │ │  time‑constant formulation introduces additional parameters (the synaptic gains \\(\\gamma_{ij}\\) and biases        │ │  \\(\\mu_{ij}\\)).  Selecting appropriate values for these parameters is non‑trivial and can affect stability,       │ │  especially in high‑dimensional networks where the Jacobian of the time‑constant may become ill‑conditioned.\n- The  │ │  theoretical analysis is restricted to autonomous (input‑free) systems.  Extending the results to input‑driven or    │ │  stochastic dynamics remains an open research direction.\n\n**Future work**\n\nFuture research should develop        │ │  learning algorithms that respect the derived bounds on time‑constants and states, perform systematic sensitivity    │ │  analyses of the synaptic parameters \\(\\gamma_{ij}\\) and \\(\\mu_{ij}\\), and broaden the                         │ │  universal‑approximation framework to encompass non‑autonomous and stochastic settings.  Addressing these            │ │  challenges will further establish LTC‑RNNs as a versatile tool for both theoretical neuroscience and practical      │ │  control applications."

            "summary": "## Summary\n\n**Cattai et al.** propose a **physics‑informed topological signal processing (TSP)**    │ │  framework for state estimation in water distribution networks (WDNs).  Unlike conventional graph‑based or purely    │ │  data‑driven methods, the approach models **nodal pressures** and **pipe flows** as signals defined on a             │ │  **second‑order cell complex** (nodes, edges, and polygonal cells).  This representation captures both pairwise      │ │  (edge) and higher‑order (cell) interactions inherent in hydraulic networks.\n\n### Core ideas\n- **Hodge            │ │  decomposition** is employed to split edge‑flow signals into three orthogonal components: irrotational, solenoidal,  │ │  and harmonic.  These components correspond to different physical behaviors but the **mass‑conservation and          │ │  energy‑conservation laws are enforced explicitly** through constraints such as \\(B_{1} f = d\\) (flow balance at   │ │  nodes) and \\(B_{T1} p = \\Phi(f)\\) (head loss relation), rather than being embedded within the decomposition.\n-  │ │  Spectral bases are built from the eigenvectors of the **combinatorial Laplacians** \\(L_{0}\\) (nodes) and          │ │  \\(L_{1}\\) (edges).  These eigenvectors serve as dictionaries for sparse reconstruction of pressures and flows     │ │  from limited sensor data.\n\n### Methodology\n1. **Pressure reconstruction**\n   - Formulated as a non‑convex       │ │  optimization problem that (i) penalizes deviation from observed pressures, (ii) includes a regularization term      │ │  \\(\\|B_{1} C^{-1/\\alpha}(|B_{T1} p|^{1/\\alpha}\\,\\text{sign}(B_{T1} p)) - d\\|\\) to enforce flow‑balance, and  │ │  (iii) imposes non‑negativity of pressures.\n   - Solved via **successive convex approximation (SCA)**: the          │ │  non‑convex term is linearized around the current iterate, yielding a sequence of strongly convex sub‑problems.\n    │ │  - Sensor locations for pressure measurements are selected with a **Max‑Det greedy algorithm** designed for          │ │  K‑bandlimited graph signals.\n\n2. **Flow reconstruction**\n   - Uses the edge‑cell incidence matrix \\(B_{2}\\)    │ │  to incorporate circulations around polygonal cells.\n   - Edge flows are expressed in the basis of either the       │ │  lower Laplacian \\(L_{1,d}\\) or the full Hodge Laplacian \\(L_{1}\\).  A **basis‑pursuit** problem selects a       │ │  compact set of eigenvectors that provide a sparse representation.\n   - Given a set of sampled edges \\(F\\), a     │ │  convex quadratic program balances (i) data‑fitting error \\(\\|(I-\\bar D_{F} U_{1,M} U_{1,M}^{T}) f - \\bar        │ │  f_{F}\\|^{2}\\) and (ii) a flow‑conservation penalty \\(\\|B_{1} f - d\\|^{2}\\).  Edge‑sensor placement again      │ │  follows the Max‑Det strategy.\n\n### Experimental validation\n- Tests on a realistic Cyprus‑city network (782       │ │  junctions, 905 pipes) and on a benchmark network (421 junctions, 495 pipes) show that the **cell‑complex‑based      │ │  approach consistently outperforms graph‑signal‑processing (GSP) baselines**.\n- For pressure estimation,            │ │  normalized mean‑squared error (MSE) decreases as more nodes are sampled and improves with larger regularization     │ │  \\(\\lambda\\).\n- For flow estimation, the cell‑complex method yields lower MSE across all sampling ratios, with   │ │  the greatest advantage when the number of sensors is small.  The improvement is attributed to the inclusion of the  │ │  upper Laplacian term \\(L_{1,u}=B_{2} B_{2}^{T}\\), which encodes circulations around polygonal cells.\n\n###       │ │  Limitations\n- The framework assumes **K‑bandlimitedness** of pressure signals on the graph Laplacian, an           │ │  idealization that may be violated under highly turbulent or transient conditions.\n- Sensor placement relies on a   │ │  greedy Max‑Det criterion, which provides no optimality guarantees and can be sensitive to the network topology.\n-  │ │  The pressure optimization via SCA yields only **local minima**; global optimality is not guaranteed, especially in  │ │  large‑scale networks with heterogeneous pipe parameters.\n- Hydraulic parameters (e.g., roughness coefficients,     │ │  pipe diameters) are treated as known constants, ignoring possible uncertainties that could affect reconstruction    │ │  accuracy.\n- The study focuses on **steady‑state** scenarios and does not address dynamic events such as pipe       │ │  bursts or sudden demand spikes.\n"

The pipeline consists of three stages:\n\n1. **Time‑frequency (TF) image generation** – EEG recordings   │ │  are segmented into 30‑second windows and transformed into TF representations using six methods: Spectrogram         │ │  (SPEC), Gaussian‑kernel (GK), Wigner–Ville (WV), Modified‑B (MB), Smoothed‑WV (SWV), and Separable kernel (SPEK).   │ │  The GK and MB methods employ the parameters **α = 0.8** and **β = 0.02**; a **Hanning window** is used for SPEC     │ │  and SWVD.\n\n2. **Tensor decomposition** – The TF images from all K channels form a third‑order tensor (time ×      │ │  frequency × channel). A CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition compresses the channel mode from K to a low rank **R   │ │  ≪ K**, producing a compact set of **\"super‑slices\"**. A rank of **R = 15** yields a normalized reconstruction     │ │  error between **0.2 and 0.3**, preserving inter‑channel, temporal, and spectral correlations while reducing         │ │  redundancy and artifacts.\n\n3. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification** – The super‑slices are fed    │ │  to a shallow CNN. Experiments explored **filter sizes of 2 × 2 and 3 × 3** and **network depths ranging from 6 to   │ │  12 convolution‑ReLU‑pool blocks**. The configuration with **3 × 3 filters and 10 layers** gave the best trade‑off   │ │  between capacity and over‑fitting. Training used a **learning rate of 0.001**, momentum **0.9**, batch size         │ │  **40**, and **19 epochs**.\n\n#### Evaluation\n- **Dataset**: CHB‑MIT pediatric seizure recordings; cross‑patient   │ │  detection is performed on 30‑second segments.\n- **Protocol**: **10‑fold cross‑validation** (10‑CV) with 10 % of    │ │  data held out for testing and the remaining 90 % split 4:1 for training/validation.\n- **Baseline comparisons**:    │ │  The tensor‑reduced TF‑CNN achieved an average accuracy of **89.63 %**, outperforming a PCA‑based TF‑CNN (**86.17    │ │  %**) and several 1‑D/2‑D baselines (≤ 86 %).\n- **PCA analysis**: Applying PCA to the 2‑D TF images, the first      │ │  **15 principal components** captured **> 85 %** of the variance; using these components in a CNN yielded the 86.17  │ │  % accuracy reported above.\n\n#### Contributions\n- A unified framework that **simultaneously reduces               │ │  dimensionality, mitigates artifacts, and preserves multi‑way EEG correlations** via CP tensor decomposition.\n- A   │ │  comprehensive empirical study of **multiple TF representations**, CNN architectural choices, and **rank             │ │  selection** (R = 15) demonstrating the effectiveness of the super‑slice approach.\n- Demonstrated **storage and     │ │  computational efficiency**: the number of input images is reduced from K channels to R super‑slices (K ≫ R),        │ │  lowering memory requirements for CNN training.\n\n#### Limitations & Future Directions (as discussed by the         │ │  authors)\n- The low‑rank assumption may not hold for high‑density EEG or highly localized pathologies; adaptive     │ │  rank‑estimation is needed.\n- Fixed TF representations per experiment; adaptive selection or fusion of TF           │ │  modalities could capture complementary information.\n- The CNN backbone is relatively shallow; deeper or            │ │  attention‑based models might better exploit the richer super‑slice features.\n- Quantitative analysis of specific   │ │  artifact suppression (e.g., eye blinks, muscle activity) is absent.\n- Validation is limited to the CHB‑MIT         │ │  pediatric dataset; testing on adult or real‑time EEG would strengthen claims of generality.\n\nOverall, the paper   │ │  introduces a novel tensor‑based reduction strategy that, when coupled with a modest CNN, delivers                   │ │  **state‑of‑the‑art seizure detection performance** while markedly reducing the dimensionality and storage burden    │ │  of multi‑channel EEG data."

(2023) introduce the **Deep     │ │  arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN)**, a reformulation of conventional Deep Artificial Neural       │ │  Networks (DANNs) that explicitly leverages the data‑driven **arbitrary Polynomial Chaos (aPC)** framework. The      │ │  principal contribution is a mathematically grounded kernel structure in which each node processes its inputs        │ │  through a **multivariate orthonormal polynomial basis** that is constructed adaptively from the empirical           │ │  distribution of the preceding layer’s activations. By replacing the customary linear weighted sum of neuron         │ │  outputs with a high‑order orthogonal expansion, the authors aim to (i) eliminate the implicit Gaussian assumption   │ │  underlying standard DANNs, (ii) reduce representational redundancy, and (iii) shift part of the non‑linearity from  │ │  hand‑crafted activation functions to the polynomial expansion itself.\n\nThe DaPC NN **generalises** the DANN:      │ │  when the polynomial degree is set to one and the basis corresponds to Hermite polynomials, the model collapses to   │ │  a conventional DANN; when there is a single layer, it reduces to a standard aPC surrogate.\n\n**Methodology** –     │ │  The paper revisits homogeneous chaos theory and the aPC construction, emphasizing that orthonormality can be        │ │  achieved from a limited set of raw moments via the Hankel matrix. It then defines the DaPC NN architecture (Eq.     │ │  13) and derives analytic expressions for node‑wise expectations, variances, Sobol sensitivity indices, and partial  │ │  derivatives with respect to the trainable weights. These expressions enable **gradient‑based optimisation** that    │ │  is identical to that used for DANNs.\n\n**Empirical evaluation** – Three benchmark problems are used: the           │ │  three‑dimensional Ishigami function, a ten‑dimensional nonlinear analytical model (ON‑10), and a CO₂                │ │  shock‑propagation case. All experiments employ identical training sets, the same loss function (MSE with Tikhonov   │ │  regularisation), and the **Levenberg‑Marquardt optimiser**. The reported results show that DaPC NN consistently     │ │  attains lower validation mean‑square error, faster convergence with respect to training‑sample size, and reduced    │ │  over‑fitting relative to conventional DANNs, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, the orthogonal   │ │  decomposition yields closed‑form estimates of output statistics and global sensitivity, which are not available in  │ │  standard DANNs.\n\nThe authors note that **the choice of polynomial degree may affect performance and therefore     │ │  requires careful selection**, and that the construction of the orthonormal basis relies on estimation of raw        │ │  moments, which must be feasible for the data at hand. \n\nThe **DaPC NN Matlab toolbox is made publicly available   │ │  online**, and the training of DaPC NN uses the same gradient‑based procedures (Levenberg‑Marquardt) as              │ │  conventional DANNs."

The focus is on three enhancement tasks – **noise reduction (NR)**, **source separation (SS)**, and  │ │  **dereverberation (DR)** – and on clarifying how the two sub‑tasks of a speech‑enhancement system, *parameter       │ │  estimation* and the *enhancement operation*, can be realized either by statistical signal‑processing theory, by     │ │  supervised deep‑learning, or by a combination of both. A unified taxonomy is introduced (Fig. 5) and                │ │  representative algorithms are discussed to illustrate the complementary strengths of the three paradigms.\n\n###    │ │  1. Hierarchy of signal models\n\n| Model | Equation(s) | Main simplifications |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Full            │ │  convolutional mixture** – the physical model of the microphone signals as a linear superposition of source signals  │ │  convolved with their acoustic impulse responses (AIRs) plus additive noise. | (1) | No approximation; captures      │ │  multi‑path propagation and reverberation. |\n| **CTF (convolutive transfer‑function) approximation** – STFT‑domain  │ │  representation where the time‑domain convolution is approximated by a short‑time convolution over frame indices. |  │ │  (2)–(4) | Neglects cross‑band filters; separates early and late reverberation. |\n| **MTF / narrow‑band             │ │  approximation** – each frequency bin is treated independently, turning the convolution into a multiplication. |     │ │  (5) | Assumes frame length much larger than AIR length; valid in low‑reverberant settings. |\n| **Anechoic          │ │  (far‑field) model** – no reverberation; ATFs are pure phase delays that depend only on the direction of arrival. |  │ │  (6) | Ignores reverberation and amplitude attenuation; yields simple steering‑vector representation. |\n\nSimpler   │ │  models are adopted because the full model is often intractable for deriving closed‑form estimators; each reduction  │ │  trades physical fidelity for mathematical tractability and computational efficiency.\n\n### 2. Model‑based          │ │  techniques (beyond MVDR)\n\n* **Acoustic beamforming** – e.g., MVDR beamformer with coefficients (8) that require   │ │  spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of speech and noise.\n* **Blind source separation (BSS)** based on independent   │ │  component analysis (ICA) – separates sources using only the observed mixture and statistical independence.\n*       │ │  **Kalman‑filter‑based dereverberation** – state‑space formulation of Eq. (14)–(17) with EM‑based parameter          │ │  estimation.\n* **Weighted prediction error (WPE)** – an AR‑based dereverberation method (Eqs. (18)–(20)) that       │ │  iteratively estimates late‑reverberation filters and source PSDs.\n\nAll these methods estimate parameters          │ │  directly from the observation (Fig. 2 left), which avoids train‑test mismatch and enables rapid adaptation with     │ │  only a few seconds of data.\n\n### 3. Data‑driven techniques\n\n* **Spectral‑domain approaches** – complex‑ratio    │ │  masking, complex spectral mapping, and magnitude‑only regression. Early work stacked real and imaginary parts of    │ │  the STFT; later work directly regressed RI components.\n* **Time‑domain encoder‑decoder networks** – replace the    │ │  STFT/iSTFT pair with learnable convolutional filters.\n* **Spatial features** – inter‑channel phase differences     │ │  (IPDs) and stacked RI values are used to provide the DNN with spatial cues.\n* **Full‑band (spectral) processing**  │ │  – BLSTM layers operate across frequency bins for each time frame, exploiting the characteristic phase pattern of a  │ │  DoA.\n* **Attention mechanisms for SCM weighting** – Eq. (23) shows that SCM computation can be expressed as a      │ │  weighted sum of instantaneous SCMs, analogous to self‑attention; attention networks can learn optimal weights for   │ │  dynamic acoustic scenes (Sec. IV‑A).\n* **Permutation‑invariant training (PIT)** – resolves the label‑permutation   │ │  problem in multi‑speaker separation.\n\nThese methods rely on large paired (clean‑degraded) training corpora;       │ │  simulated data are often used because collecting real paired recordings is difficult.\n\n### 4. Hybrid categories   │ │  (Fig. 5)\n\n1. **Data‑driven parameter estimation for model‑based enhancement** – DNNs predict masks or SCMs that   │ │  are then fed to a conventional beamformer or WPE.\n2. **Combined data‑driven and model‑based parameter              │ │  estimation** – e.g., DNN‑produced masks serve as priors for a spatial mixture model; EM refines them, or            │ │  diarization DNNs guide model‑based mask estimation (Eq. (24)).\n3. **Joint model‑based and data‑driven              │ │  enhancement** – architectures such as **TF‑GridNet** (DNN → beamformer → DNN) that interleave learned nonlinear     │ │  processing with a model‑based beamformer or multi‑frame Wiener filter.\n\nHybrid systems aim to retain the          │ │  robustness and interpretability of statistical models while exploiting the expressive power of deep                 │ │  networks.\n\n### 5. End‑to‑end training caveats\n\n* The whole chain can be made differentiable (SCM computation,   │ │  beamforming, iSTFT) and optimized w.r.t. a single loss (e.g., time‑domain SNR) – Fig. 6 illustrates this.\n*        │ │  **Curriculum learning** is often required; starting end‑to‑end training from scratch may lead to poor convergence,  │ │  whereas fine‑tuning pre‑trained components yields faster and more stable training.\n* **Loss of modularity** – a    │ │  system trained jointly with a specific ASR backend may not transfer well to a different recognizer.\n* **Potential  │ │  mismatch** – when the training loss is defined on downstream ASR performance, paired clean‑noisy data are no        │ │  longer needed, but the enhancement network may over‑fit to the ASR model’s idiosyncrasies.\n\n### 6. Purely         │ │  data‑driven trend (all‑neural)\n\n* **Learnable filterbanks** replace the STFT, providing adaptive time‑frequency   │ │  resolution.\n* **Direct neural estimation of beamformer coefficients** – RNNs predict SCMs or the beamforming       │ │  weights themselves (Sec. V‑E).\n* **Complete removal of linear beamforming** – DNNs act as nonlinear                │ │  spatial‑spectral filters that can surpass the MVDR in non‑Gaussian settings (e.g., competing speakers) and have     │ │  been shown to improve performance when the linear beamformer is omitted.\n\nThe authors note that comparing these   │ │  systems across publications is difficult because results are reported on different corpora.\n\n### 7. Conclusions   │ │  and trade‑offs\n\n* The field is moving toward hybrid and fully data‑driven approaches because model‑based methods  │ │  have reached a level of maturity where remaining approximations (e.g., narrow‑band, time‑invariant SCMs) become     │ │  limiting.\n* **Advantages of data‑driven components** – ability to learn nonlinear mappings, overcome simplifying   │ │  assumptions, and achieve state‑of‑the‑art results on benchmark datasets.\n* **Drawbacks** – heavy dependence on     │ │  large, representative training data; risk of catastrophic failure on out‑of‑domain inputs; increased computational  │ │  and memory demand; possible over‑parameterisation when many DNN modules are stacked.\n* **Hybrid systems**          │ │  mitigate some of these issues by using statistical models as regularisers (e.g., guided source separation) and by   │ │  preserving fast adaptation to new acoustic scenes, as demonstrated by their success in the CHiME‑6 and CHiME‑7      │ │  challenges.\n* Future work should include **benchmark‑level quantitative evaluations**, **lightweight hybrid        │ │  architectures**, and **adaptive training curricula** that balance the theoretical guarantees of model‑based         │ │  components with the flexibility of deep learning.\n\nOverall, Haeb‑Umbach *et al.* (2025) argue that a judicious    │ │  combination of model‑based and data‑driven techniques offers the most promising path forward for robust,            │ │  high‑performance multi‑channel speech enhancement."

The development is built on two mathematical foundations:\n\n1. **Convex        │ │  conjugacy** – Section 2 introduces the conjugate function and shows how certain non‑convex cost functions can be    │ │  expressed exactly as the pointwise maximum of convex conjugates.\n2. **Minimax theorem** – Section 3 uses the       │ │  classical minimax theorem to derive the MM4MM update rule as a saddle‑point problem, where the inner maximization   │ │  provides a convex upper bound and the outer minimization updates the iterate.\n\nThe paper also discusses two       │ │  special cases of the framework:\n- **Constrained minimization** (Section 4.1)\n- **Worst‑case (robust)              │ │  minimization** (Section 4.2)\n\nA broad range of signal‑processing applications are presented to illustrate the     │ │  versatility of MM4MM (Section 5).

Eigen‑decomposition of \\(P\\) yields:\n  -               │ │  **Active‑subspace directions** – eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues define a low‑dimensional      │ │  subspace that captures most of the model’s variability.\n  - **Feature‑importance scores** – eigenvectors weighted  │ │  by their eigenvalues give a global importance vector for the input variables.\n- **Regularisation**: Two penalties  │ │  are used – \\(\\lambda_w\\) on the output weights and \\(\\lambda_u\\) on the entries of \\(U\\).  Empirically,     │ │  \\(\\lambda_u\\) has a stronger impact on validation error than \\(\\lambda_w\\).\n- **Centre‑selection             │ │  strategies**: (i) unsupervised k‑means (variant **GRBFNN\\_k**) and (ii) supervised learning of centre locations    │ │  (**GRBFNN\\_c**).\n- **Implementation**: A PyTorch version is publicly available on GitHub                          │ │  (https://github.com/dannyzx/Gaussian‑RBFNN).\n- **Benchmarks**: 20 real‑world tabular datasets (6 binary            │ │  classification, 4 multiclass classification, 9 regression, 1 time‑series) plus **three synthetic datasets with      │ │  known ground‑truth feature relevance**.\n- **Protocol**: 5‑fold cross‑validation repeated with 20 random seeds;     │ │  statistical significance assessed with the **Wilcoxon signed‑rank test (α = 0.05)**.\n- **Competitors**: SVM,       │ │  Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, FT‑Transformer, and recent deep‑learning embedding/feature‑selection methods (DFS,     │ │  FIDL).\n- **Main findings**:\n  - **Predictive performance** – GRBFNN\\_c achieved statistically significant best   │ │  results on four regression datasets; GRBFNN\\_k was top‑performing on two classification datasets.  Overall the     │ │  combined GRBFNN approaches were best on **7 out of 20 benchmarks**.\n  - **Interpretability** –                     │ │  Eigen‑decomposition provided meaningful active‑subspace visualisations and feature‑importance rankings that         │ │  matched the synthetic ground truth and were competitive with or superior to tree‑based and deep‑embedding           │ │  baselines on real‑world tasks.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Liquid‑Time‑Constant Recurrent Neural Networks (LTC‑RNNs)**\n-   │ │  **Core idea**: Each neuron's membrane time‑constant varies dynamically with the membrane potentials of its          │ │  presynaptic partners via sigmoidal chemical‑synapse models (gain \\(\\gamma_{ij}\\), bias \\(\\mu_{ij}\\)) and      │ │  linear gap‑junction couplings.\n- **Theoretical contribution**: A universal‑approximation theorem (Theorem 1) is    │ │  proved in three steps:\n  1. **Feed‑forward approximation** of the target autonomous vector field using static      │ │  universal‑approximation results.\n  2. **Embedding** of this approximation into a continuous‑time system whose      │ │  overall system time‑constant \\(\\tau_{\\text{sys}}\\) is chosen sufficiently large to guarantee stability.\n  3.   │ │  **Bounding** of the LTC‑RNN trajectories within a compact region of state‑space, using Lemma 2 (bounds on           │ │  individual neuron time‑constants) and Lemma 3 (bounds on membrane potentials).\n- **Limitations**:\n  - Proof       │ │  assumes exact knowledge of the target vector field on a compact domain and Lipschitz continuity; noisy data may     │ │  violate these assumptions.\n  - Selecting appropriate synaptic gains \\(\\gamma_{ij}\\) and biases \\(\\mu_{ij}\\)  │ │  is non‑trivial and can affect stability, especially in high‑dimensional networks where the Jacobian of the          │ │  time‑constant may become ill‑conditioned.\n  - Analysis is restricted to autonomous (input‑free) systems;           │ │  extending to input‑driven or stochastic dynamics remains an open problem.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Deep arbitrary        │ │  Polynomial Chaos Neural Network (DaPC NN)**\n- **Innovation**: Replaces the usual linear weighted sum inside a      │ │  neuron with a multivariate orthonormal polynomial expansion built from the empirical distribution of the previous   │ │  layer’s activations (arbitrary Polynomial Chaos, aPC).\n- **Key points**:\n  - The polynomial degree must be        │ │  chosen carefully; too low limits expressive power, too high may cause over‑fitting and numerical instability.\n  -  │ │  Construction of the orthonormal basis relies on accurate estimation of raw moments of the data; sufficient sample   │ │  size is required.\n  - Training employs the Levenberg‑Marquardt optimiser, identical to that used for conventional  │ │  deep artificial neural networks.\n- **Empirical results**: On three benchmark problems (Ishigami function, a        │ │  10‑dimensional nonlinear model, and a CO₂ shock‑propagation case) DaPC NN achieved lower validation MSE, faster     │ │  convergence with fewer training samples, and used fewer trainable parameters than standard DANNs, while also        │ │  providing closed‑form output statistics and Sobol sensitivity indices.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Tensor‑Based             │ │  Dimensionality‑Reduction Pipeline for EEG Seizure Detection**\n- **Pipeline**: Multi‑channel EEG → six              │ │  time‑frequency (TF) transforms (SPEC, GK, WV, MB, SWV, SPEK) → third‑order tensor (time × frequency × channel) →    │ │  CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition reducing the channel mode to rank \\(R = 15\\).\n- **CNN classifier**: A       │ │  shallow CNN processes the resulting “super‑slices”.\n- **Performance**:\n  - Average classification accuracy on     │ │  the CHB‑MIT pediatric dataset: **89.63 %** (10‑fold cross‑validation).\n  - Normalised reconstruction error of the  │ │  CP decomposition: **0.2–0.3**.\n  - Training hyper‑parameters: learning rate = 0.001, momentum = 0.9, batch size =  │ │  40, 19 epochs.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - Low‑rank assumption may not hold for high‑density EEG or highly localized   │ │  pathologies; adaptive rank estimation is needed.\n  - Fixed TF representation; adaptive selection or fusion could   │ │  capture complementary information.\n  - Shallow CNN; deeper or attention‑based architectures might improve          │ │  results.\n  - No quantitative analysis of artifact suppression (e.g., eye blinks, muscle activity).\n\n---\n\n####  │ │  5. **Graph‑Based Semantic Language for Signal Processing**\n- **Representation**: Signals are parsed into           │ │  **components (C)** and **predicates (P)** forming directed bipartite graphs with hierarchical attribute sets        │ │  \\(\\Theta = \\{\\theta^{(1)}, \\theta^{(2)}, \\dots\\}\\).  Two graph levels are defined: class‑level abstraction  │ │  \\(S = (C_S, P_S, E_S)\\) and instance‑level detail \\(D = (C_D, P_D, E_D)\\).\n- **Goal operator** \\(G\\) (Eq.    │ │  17): matches a pair of graph motifs \\((G_S, G_D)\\) within a prescribed **hop‑neighbourhood \\(l_h\\)** and        │ │  **attribute depth \\(l_a\\)**; graphs that satisfy the match are retained for further processing, while others are  │ │  discarded.\n- **Lossless encoding** of the bi‑adjacency matrices:\n  - Adjacency‑list representation (≈             │ │  \\(O(n\\log m + m\\log n)\\) bits).\n  - Huffman coding applied to adjacency lists.\n  - Universal integer codes    │ │  such as Elias‑γ and Elias‑δ for edge indices (optionally followed by an additional Huffman step).\n- **Joint        │ │  source‑channel coding**: A discrete memoryless channel model (Eq. 67) is used; the average transmission cost        │ │  \\(L_{\\text{DMC}}\\) (Eq. 68) incorporates channel transition probabilities and a chosen distortion metric (MSE,   │ │  TVD, log‑cosh, quantile loss, or \\(\\ell_p\\) norm).\n- **TCQ results for dominant 128‑dimensional attribute       │ │  vectors**:\n  - **2‑bit TCQ**: Normalised classification accuracy **55 %–67 %** of the 32‑bit benchmark             │ │  (contradicts the paper’s claim of “near‑full” accuracy at 2 bits).\n  - **3‑bit TCQ**: Accuracy **91 %–92 %** of    │ │  the benchmark.\n  - **4‑bit TCQ**: Accuracy **96 %–97 %**, essentially matching full‑resolution performance.\n-     │ │  **Open issues**: Need for automated ontology learning, energy‑aware implementations for IoT, and secure             │ │  goal‑dissemination mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Millimeter‑Wave Joint Radar‑Communications (mmWave JRC)          │ │  Survey**\n- **Practical advantages** (abstract): low cost, compact size, reduced power consumption, spectrum        │ │  sharing, improved performance, and enhanced safety through richer information exchange.\n- **mmWave motivation**:   │ │  Wide unlicensed bandwidth enables multi‑gigabit‑per‑second short‑range links; the same bandwidth gives high range   │ │  resolution for radar, making mmWave attractive for automotive, gesture‑recognition, health‑monitoring, etc.\n-      │ │  **Channel impairments**: Strong attenuation and penetration loss (LOS‑dominant), high path‑loss mitigated by large  │ │  antenna arrays, ultra‑wide bandwidth demanding high‑rate ADCs, power‑consumption limits of ADCs, and                │ │  nanosecond‑scale coherence times.\n- **Architectures**:\n  1. **Spectral coexistence** – separate radar and         │ │  communication subsystems with interference mitigation (spatial filtering, interference alignment, limited CSI       │ │  exchange).\n  2. **Co‑design** – a single transceiver jointly serves both functions, enabling joint waveform        │ │  optimisation.\n- **Performance metrics**:\n  - Radar‑centric metrics: **probability of detection**,                 │ │  **mis‑detection**, **false‑alarm rate**, and the **ambiguity function (AF)** (quantifies range‑Doppler resolution   │ │  and is used to compare waveforms such as PMCW vs. OFDMA).\n  - Communications metrics: CRLB, capacity, BER,         │ │  etc.\n- **Waveform design**: CW, FMCW, PMCW (radar‑centric); MCPC, OFDM, OFDMA (multi‑carrier); joint‑coding with   │ │  IEEE 802.11ad (Golay sequences enable cm‑level range resolution while supporting Gbps data rates);                  │ │  spatial‑DoF‑based designs (radar‑centric spatial modulation).\n- **Resource allocation & cognitive adaptation**:\n  │ │  - **Active subcarrier selection** and **power control** are formulated as optimisation problems, e.g.,              │ │  **water‑filling** for mutual‑information maximisation and **Neyman‑Pearson‑constrained** optimisation for           │ │  detection performance.\n  - Cognitive mechanisms such as spectrum cartography, fast waveform redesign, sub‑Nyquist  │ │  sampling, and reinforcement‑learning / game‑theoretic approaches (Nash or Stackelberg equilibria) for dynamic       │ │  spectrum sharing.\n- **Limitations & future directions**: Assumptions of ideal narrow‑band steering vectors,        │ │  perfect synchronization, and block‑fading channels may be violated by nanosecond‑scale coherence times and          │ │  hardware impairments; extensions to sub‑mmWave/THz frequencies are anticipated.\n\n---\n\n#### 7.                   │ │  **Physics‑Informed Topological Signal Processing (TSP) for Water‑Distribution Networks**\n- **Signal model**:       │ │  Nodal pressures \\(p\\) and pipe flows \\(f\\) are treated as signals on a second‑order cell complex (nodes,        │ │  edges, polygonal cells).  Conservation laws are enforced explicitly: \\(B_{1} f = d\\) (node flow balance) and      │ │  \\(B_{T1} p = \\Phi(f)\\) (head‑loss relation).\n- **Pressure reconstruction** (non‑convex):\n  \\[ \\min_{p}\\;    │ │  \\|W_{p}(p-\\tilde p)\\|^{2} + \\lambda\\,\\|B_{1} C^{-1/\\alpha}(|B_{T1} p|^{1/\\alpha}\\,\\text{sign}(B_{T1} p))  │ │  - d\\|^{2} \\]\n  subject to non‑negativity of pressures.  The second term is a **pressure regularisation** that    │ │  enforces flow‑balance.\n- **Solution method**: Successive convex approximation (SCA) linearises the non‑convex      │ │  term around the current iterate, yielding a sequence of strongly convex sub‑problems.\n- **Flow reconstruction**:   │ │  Uses the edge‑cell incidence matrix \\(B_{2}\\) to capture circulations around polygonal cells.  A convex           │ │  quadratic program balances data‑fitting error on sampled edges with a flow‑conservation penalty \\(\\|B_{1} f -     │ │  d\\|^{2}\\).\n- **Sensor placement**: Max‑Det greedy algorithm selects measurement nodes (pressures) or edges       │ │  (flows) under a **K‑bandlimitedness** assumption.\n- **Experimental validation**: Tests on a realistic Cyprus‑city  │ │  network (782 nodes, 905 pipes) and a benchmark network (421 nodes, 495 pipes) show lower MSE than                   │ │  graph‑signal‑processing baselines, especially when the number of sensors is small.\n- **Limitations**: Assumes      │ │  K‑bandlimitedness, uses greedy Max‑Det placement with no optimality guarantee, SCA yields only local minima,        │ │  hydraulic parameters are treated as known constants, and the study focuses on steady‑state scenarios (dynamic       │ │  events are not addressed).\n\n---\n\n#### 8. **Taxonomy of Model‑Based, Data‑Driven, and Hybrid Multi‑Channel       │ │  Speech‑Enhancement Techniques**\n- **Model‑based methods** (beyond classic MVDR): Kalman‑filter‑based               │ │  dereverberation (state‑space EM), Weighted Prediction Error (WPE) dereverberation (AR‑based late‑reverberation      │ │  filter), Blind Source Separation via ICA, and various beamforming formulations.\n- **Data‑driven components**:\n    │ │  - **Spatial features** such as Inter‑Channel Phase Differences (IPDs) and **attention‑based weighting of            │ │  instantaneous spatial covariance matrices (SCMs)** – the attention mechanism can be interpreted as a                │ │  self‑attention that learns optimal SCM weights for each time‑frequency bin.\n  - Spectral‑domain DNNs that predict  │ │  complex‑ratio masks, complex spectral mapping, or magnitude‑only regression; time‑domain encoder‑decoder networks   │ │  with learnable convolutional filterbanks.\n  - **Permutation‑Invariant Training (PIT)** for multi‑speaker           │ │  separation, which resolves the label‑permutation ambiguity during training.\n- **Hybrid categories** (Fig. 5):\n    │ │  1. **DNN‑driven parameter estimation for model‑based enhancement** – DNN predicts masks/SCMs that feed a            │ │  conventional beamformer or WPE.\n  2. **Combined DNN and model‑based parameter estimation** – e.g., DNN‑produced    │ │  priors refined by EM, or diarisation DNNs guiding mask estimation.\n  3. **Joint model‑based and data‑driven        │ │  enhancement** – architectures such as TF‑GridNet (DNN → beamformer → DNN) interleave learned nonlinear processing   │ │  with model‑based blocks.\n- **All‑neural trend**: Learnable filterbanks replace the STFT, learned spatial‑spectral  │ │  filters replace linear beamforming, and recurrent networks directly predict beamformer coefficients.\n-             │ │  **Drawbacks of fully neural approaches**: higher computational and memory demand, risk of over‑parameterisation,    │ │  loss of modularity (systems tuned to a specific downstream ASR may not transfer), and potential instability         │ │  without careful curriculum learning.\n\n---\n\n#### 9. **Min‑Max Majorization‑Minimization (MM4MM) Framework**\n-   │ │  **Mathematical foundations**:\n  1. **Convex conjugacy** (Section 2) – expresses certain non‑convex cost functions  │ │  as the pointwise maximum of convex conjugates, providing an exact majorizer.\n  2. **Minimax theorem** (Section 3)  │ │  – leads to a saddle‑point formulation where the inner maximisation yields a convex upper bound and the outer        │ │  minimisation updates the iterate.\n- **Special cases**:\n  1. **Constrained minimisation** (Section 4.1).\n  2.     │ │  **Worst‑case (robust) minimisation** (Section 4.2).\n- **Applications demonstrated (Section 5)** – the unified      │ │  MM4MM view is applied to ten diverse signal‑processing problems:\n  1. Total‑variation filtering.\n  2. Phase       │ │  retrieval for Poisson noise.\n  3. Outlier‑robust phase retrieval.\n  4. RSS‑based source localisation.\n  5.       │ │  Optimal sensor placement.\n  6. Independent vector analysis.\n  7. Dual‑function beamforming design.\n  8. Optimal  │ │  experiment design.\n  9. Quantum state discrimination.\n  10. Fair principal component analysis (PCA).\n  For each  │ │  case the paper shows how to construct valid majorizers that guarantee convergence while accommodating the specific  │ │  objective.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Perspective\nAll nine works illustrate a converging trend: **hybrid systems that   │ │  combine learnable, data‑driven components (neural kernels, polynomial chaos expansions, tensor decompositions,      │ │  graph‑based semantics, attention mechanisms) with rigorous physical models, optimisation theory, and                │ │  interpretability tools**.  This synergy yields improved predictive performance, resource‑efficient                  │ │  implementations, and robustness to real‑world uncertainties, pointing toward the next generation of intelligent     │ │  signal‑processing systems.\n"
