            "summary": "The paper introduces the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT), a novel framework that extends Vision Transformers (ViTs) to non‑Euclidean surface data by reformulating surface learning as a sequence‑to‑sequence problem. The core contribution lies in a surface‑patching mechanism that projects arbitrary genus‑zero meshes onto a regularly tessellated icosphere, partitions the sphere into equal‑area triangular patches, and flattens each patch into a token for the transformer encoder. This design circumvents the limited receptive field and rotational equivariance constraints inherent to existing geometric deep‑learning (gDL) methods such as S2CNN, ChebNet, GConvNet, MoNet and spherical U‑Nets, while preserving the global‑context modelling capabilities of self‑attention.\n\nMethodologically, SiT adopts a vanilla ViT encoder (12 layers) with multi‑head self‑attention and feed‑forward networks, instantiated in two scales (SiT‑tiny and SiT‑small) mirroring DeiT configurations. Input surface features (sulcal depth, curvature, cortical thickness, T1w/T2w ratio) are first resampled onto a 32 k‑vertex template, projected onto a sixth‑order icosphere (≈41 k vertices), and then aggregated into 320 patches of 153 vertices each. Positional embeddings and an additional token encoding scan age are concatenated before transformer processing. The authors explore three training regimes—training from scratch, ImageNet‑pre‑training, and self‑supervised masked‑patch‑prediction (MPP) pre‑training—combined with data augmentation (random rotations) and dropout. Experiments on the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset evaluate two neonatal phenotypes: post‑menstrual age at scan (PMA) and gestational age at birth (GA), both in template‑aligned and native (unregistered) spaces.\n\nEmpirically, SiT‑small pre‑trained with MPP attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) across tasks (0.85 weeks for GA, 1.12 weeks for PMA), outperforming the best gDL baseline (MoNet, MAE ≈ 1.05 weeks) and showing reduced performance degradation on unregistered data. Pre‑training on ImageNet yields modest gains, while MPP self‑supervision provides the most consistent improvements, particularly when coupled with rotational augmentation. The authors also demonstrate a de‑confounding strategy that injects scan age as an extra embedding, further enhancing GA prediction.\n\nDespite these advances, the study exhibits several limitations. First, the reliance on spherical projection restricts applicability to genus‑zero surfaces; extending SiT to higher‑genus meshes would require non‑trivial topological handling. Second, the patching scheme enforces a fixed spatial granularity, potentially discarding fine‑scale geometric details critical for certain biomedical tasks. Third, the transformer architecture lacks explicit inductive biases such as rotational equivariance, which may limit robustness to arbitrary orientations despite augmentation. Fourth, the experimental validation is confined to a single neonatal MRI cohort, raising concerns about generalisability to adult brains or other modalities. Finally, the computational overhead of transformer training on high‑resolution meshes remains substantial, and the impact of larger pre‑training corpora or multi‑task learning is not explored. Future work should address these constraints by incorporating hierarchical or adaptive patching, designing equivariant attention mechanisms, and evaluating SiT on diverse surface datasets.\n",

            "paper_id": "Glance-and-Gaze Vision Transformer",
            "summary": "The Glance-and-Gaze Vision Transformer (GG‑Transformer) addresses the quadratic complexity of standard self‑attention, which hampers the application of vision Transformers to high‑resolution, dense‑prediction tasks. Building on the observation that human perception alternates between a rapid global \"glance\" and a focused local \"gaze\", the authors propose a dual‑branch Transformer block. The Glance branch performs self‑attention on adaptively‑dilated partitions of the feature map; tokens belonging to a partition are sampled with a dilation rate proportional to the spatial dimensions, thus preserving a global receptive field while reducing the attention matrix to linear size. The Gaze branch supplements the Glance output with a lightweight depth‑wise convolution that captures fine‑grained local interactions across partition boundaries. Both branches operate in parallel and are merged by an inverse dilated‑splitting operation, yielding a feature map of identical spatial layout to the input. The resulting GG‑MSA module has a computational cost of \\(4NC^2+2M^2NC+k^2NC\\) (with \\(M\\) and \\(k\\) constant), offering linear scaling with respect to the token count while retaining global context.\n\nEmpirically, GG‑Transformer is instantiated in two configurations (GG‑T and GG‑S) that match the parameter and FLOP budgets of Swin‑T and Swin‑S respectively. Trained on ImageNet‑1K under the same recipe as Swin, GG‑T achieves 82.0% top‑1 accuracy (+0.8% over Swin‑T) and GG‑S reaches 83.4% (+0.2%). On ADE20K semantic segmentation (UperNet), GG‑T attains 46.4% mIoU with single‑scale testing, surpassing ResNet‑50, PVT‑Small and Swin‑T (multi‑scale) by 3.6–0.6%. In COCO object detection (Mask‑RCNN) and instance segmentation (Cascaded Mask‑RCNN), GG‑T improves box AP from 43.7% (Swin‑T) to 44.1% and mask AP from 39.8% to 39.9%, while GG‑S yields comparable gains over Swin‑S. Ablation studies confirm that both branches are necessary: Glance‑only or Gaze‑only configurations degrade performance relative to the baseline, whereas their combination recovers and exceeds it. Replacing the Gaze convolution with a local‑window attention incurs a 1.21% drop, suggesting depth‑wise convolutions remain more effective for short‑range modeling.\n\nDespite these advantages, the paper acknowledges several limitations. First, GG‑Transformer inherits the data‑efficiency concerns of vision Transformers; stronger variants tend to over‑fit on modest‑size datasets such as ADE20K, necessitating large‑scale pre‑training or aggressive regularization. Second, the adaptive dilated splitting relies on a fixed partition size (\\(M\\)) and a deterministic dilation schedule, which may be sub‑optimal for images whose aspect ratios differ markedly from the training distribution, potentially causing degraded attention quality when test‑time resolutions diverge. Third, the depth‑wise convolution, while inexpensive, introduces an inductive bias toward isotropic locality that may not capture anisotropic structures (e.g., elongated objects) as effectively as more expressive local attention mechanisms. Finally, the authors briefly mention broader societal implications of more capable AI systems but do not discuss bias in the training data or the environmental cost of pre‑training large Transformers. Future work could explore dynamic partitioning strategies, hybrid Gaze modules that combine convolution with adaptive local attention, and systematic robustness analyses across varying image scales and domains.",

            "paper_id": "ViTAEv2_ Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring Inductive Bias for Image Recognition and Beyond",
            "summary": "Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capability in modelling long‑range dependencies via self‑attention, yet they fundamentally treat images as 1‑D token sequences and lack intrinsic inductive biases (IBs) such as locality and scale‑invariance that are naturally embedded in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  Zhang et al. (2022) address this gap by explicitly incorporating two IBs—locality and multi‑scale context—into a novel transformer architecture named ViTAE (Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring Inductive bias) and its multi‑stage extension ViTAEv2.  The core contribution lies in the design of two complementary cell types: a Reduction Cell (RC) that embeds multi‑scale information through a pyramid reduction module (PRM) employing atrous convolutions with varied dilation rates, and a Normal Cell (NC) that fuses a parallel convolutional module (PCM) with standard multi‑head self‑attention (MHSA).  By stacking RCs and NCs either isotropically or across four stages, the authors construct a family of models ranging from 4.8 M to 644 M parameters.  Training is performed with supervised ImageNet‑1K as well as self‑supervised MAE pre‑training, and extensive experiments on ImageNet, ImageNet‑Real, COCO, ADE20K, and AP10K show that ViTAE‑H (644 M) achieves 88.5 % Top‑1 accuracy on ImageNet‑val and 91.2 % on ImageNet‑Real without external data, surpassing Swin‑Transformer and other state‑of‑the‑art ViTs of comparable size.  Moreover, ViTAEv2‑B (89.7 M) yields 84.6 % Top‑1 with 10 % of the training data, evidencing superior data‑efficiency.  Downstream evaluations reveal consistent gains: object detection (Mask‑RCNN, Cascade‑RCNN) improves AP by up to 2.6 points over Swin‑T; semantic segmentation (ADE20K) gains 3–4 % mIoU; and animal pose estimation (AP‑10K) increases AP by 3 % compared with ResNet‑50 and Swin‑T backbones.  Ablation studies confirm that early fusion of PCM and MHSA, batch‑norm within PCM, and modest dilation rates in PRM are critical for performance, while larger dilations or late fusion degrade accuracy.\n\nDespite these strengths, the work exhibits several limitations.  First, the introduced convolutions increase memory footprint and computational cost, particularly at high resolutions; although the authors mitigate this with Performer‑based attention in early stages, the trade‑off remains unfavorable for ultra‑large inputs.  Second, the reliance on handcrafted dilation schedules and fixed kernel sizes introduces architectural rigidity, limiting adaptability to novel domains where optimal receptive‑field configurations may differ.  Third, the evaluation focuses primarily on standard benchmarks; robustness to distribution shift, adversarial attacks, or real‑world low‑light conditions is only briefly addressed, leaving open questions about generalisation beyond curated datasets.  Fourth, the self‑supervised pre‑training follows MAE with a high masking ratio, which may obscure the benefits of the IBs when a large proportion of tokens are removed, suggesting a potential bias toward datasets with rich textures.  Finally, while ViTAEv2 demonstrates data‑efficiency, training still requires lengthy schedules (up to 1,600 epochs for large models), indicating that the inductive bias does not fully alleviate the data‑hungry nature of transformer models.\n\nIn summary, ViTAE/ViTAEv2 present a compelling integration of CNN‑style inductive biases into transformer backbones, achieving state‑of‑the‑art accuracy and efficiency across classification and dense prediction tasks.  Future work could explore dynamic, learnable dilation strategies, more lightweight convolutional branches, and broader robustness assessments to fully realize the promise of bias‑augmented vision transformers.\n",

            "paper_id": "Evo-ViT_ Slow-Fast Token Evolution for Dynamic Vision Transformer",
            "summary": "Evo-ViT: Slow‑Fast Token Evolution for Dynamic Vision Transformer addresses the persistent computational burden of Vision Transformers (ViTs), whose quadratic complexity with respect to token count limits their practical deployment. The authors’ primary contribution is a self‑motivated \"slow‑fast\" token evolution framework that simultaneously preserves the spatial structure of the input and enables dynamic token reduction from the outset of training. Unlike prior token‑pruning pipelines, which either discard tokens (leading to incomplete spatial information) or require costly pre‑training and static pruning masks, Evo‑ViT leverages the native class token attention to perform instance‑wise token selection. Informative tokens are identified via an evolved global class attention that aggregates class attention across layers, while the remaining placeholder tokens are retained and updated via a lightweight fast‑path. The informative tokens undergo a \"slow\" update through the full multi‑head self‑attention (MSA) and feed‑forward network (FFN), whereas placeholder tokens are summarised into a representative token and subsequently propagated to all placeholders via a residual‑based fast update. This bifurcated updating preserves full information flow, mitigates the loss of background context, and maintains compatibility with both flat‑structure ViTs (e.g., DeiT) and deep‑narrow architectures (e.g., LeViT).\n\nMethodologically, Evo‑ViT introduces three key components: (1) a structure‑preserving token selection module that uses the global class attention α·A_{k-1}^{cls,g}+(1-α)·A_k^{cls} to stabilize token importance across layers; (2) a slow‑fast token updating mechanism that computes slow updates for informative tokens via standard MSA/FFN and fast updates for placeholders using the residuals of a representative token; and (3) a layer‑to‑stage training schedule that progressively stabilises token selection, reducing the need for explicit distillation losses. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet‑1K demonstrate that Evo‑ViT accelerates DeiT‑S by over 60% throughput with a mere 0.4% top‑1 accuracy drop, and yields comparable gains on LeViT despite its inherently reduced token redundancy. Ablation studies confirm the additive benefit of each component, and visualisations illustrate that token selection consistently focuses on foreground objects while preserving background tokens for contextual reasoning.\n\nDespite its promising results, Evo‑ViT exhibits several limitations. First, the reliance on class token attention assumes that the CLS token reliably reflects token importance throughout training; this may not hold for tasks lacking a clear global class token (e.g., dense prediction) or for datasets with highly ambiguous foreground/background delineations. Second, the fast‑update path aggregates placeholder tokens into a single representative token, potentially oversimplifying diverse background cues and limiting expressiveness in scenes with multiple informative background regions. Third, the layer‑to‑stage schedule, while effective for ImageNet classification, introduces additional hyper‑parameters (e.g., stage boundaries, α) whose optimal settings may vary across architectures and resolutions, raising concerns about reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, the method has been evaluated only on classification; extending to detection or segmentation may require redesigning the token‑selection criteria. Finally, the computational overhead of maintaining both slow and fast pathways, albeit modest, could diminish gains on hardware with limited parallelism. Future work should explore adaptive class‑attention mechanisms for non‑classification tasks, richer placeholder representations (e.g., multi‑prototype summarisation), and automated schedule optimisation to broaden the applicability of slow‑fast token evolution across diverse vision domains.\n",

            "paper_id": "Vision Transformer with Quadrangle Attention",
            "summary": "In recent vision transformer (ViT) research, window‑based self‑attention has been adopted to reduce the quadratic complexity of global attention while preserving strong performance on a variety of visual tasks.  Nevertheless, existing designs rely on hand‑crafted, fixed‑size rectangular windows that are agnostic to the geometry of objects in the scene, thereby limiting the ability of the model to capture long‑range dependencies for objects of diverse scales, shapes, and orientations.  To address this limitation, Zhang *et al.* propose a novel **Quadrangle Attention (QA)** mechanism and integrate it into both plain and hierarchical ViTs, resulting in a new family of architectures called **QFormer**.\n\n**Methodology.**  QA extends the conventional window partitioning by learning, for each head, a projective transformation that maps a default square window to an arbitrary quadrangle.  A lightweight quadrangle‑regression module predicts nine parameters (scale, shear, rotation, translation, and projection) via average‑pooling, LeakyReLU, and a 1\\times1 convolution applied to the window’s features.  The transformation is factorised into elementary operations (scaling, shearing, rotation, translation, projection) to improve training stability.  Tokens within the resulting quadrangle are sampled using bilinear interpolation; tokens falling outside the feature map are padded with zeros.  A regularization term penalises quadrangles that extend beyond the valid region, encouraging reasonable coverage.  The attention computation itself remains unchanged (query‑key‑value dot‑product followed by softmax), thus incurring only a negligible overhead (≈5% extra FLOPs) compared with standard window attention.\n\n**Key Results.**  Extensive experiments on ImageNet‑1K, MS‑COCO, ADE20K, and COCO‑keypoint benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains across classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation.  For example, QFormer‑T achieves 83.2% top‑1 accuracy on ImageNet‑1K at 384×384 resolution, surpassing Swin‑T by 0.9% while using comparable parameters and memory.  In detection, QFormerp‑B improves Mask‑RCNN mAP\\_bb from 51.6 to 52.3 and mAP\\_mk from 45.9 to 46.6.  Semantic segmentation sees up to a 2.4 mIoU improvement over Swin‑T, and pose estimation benefits from a 1.5 AP gain.  Ablation studies confirm that each basic transformation contributes incrementally, and that the composed transformation outperforms a direct prediction of the full projective matrix.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions.**  Despite its flexibility, QA inherits several constraints.  First, the quadrangle regression operates independently per head and per window, which may lead to inconsistent shapes across heads and hinder joint optimization; a unified multi‑head formulation could improve coherence.  Second, the sampling strategy discards tokens outside the feature map, potentially wasting informative context when quadrangles straddle image borders; adaptive padding or border‑aware extensions might alleviate this.  Third, the current regularization relies on a hand‑tuned hyper‑parameter λ, and the authors report sensitivity to its value, indicating a need for more principled constraints (e.g., learned priors on shape variability).  Fourth, QA is evaluated only with supervised pre‑training; its impact on self‑supervised or multimodal pre‑training remains unexplored.  Finally, the computational overhead, while modest, stems from bilinear sampling that is not fully optimized in existing deep‑learning libraries, limiting inference speed on hardware where matrix multiplication is highly accelerated.  Future work could therefore focus on (i) designing head‑sharing transformation predictors, (ii) integrating border‑aware or content‑aware sampling, (iii) learning regularization directly from data, (iv) extending QA to self‑supervised pipelines, and (v) implementing hardware‑friendly sampling kernels to close the speed gap with conventional window attention.\n",

            "paper_id": "OAMixer_ Object-aware Mixing Layer for Vision Transformers",
            "summary": "OAMixer: Object‑aware Mixing Layer for Vision Transformers introduces a universal framework that endows patch‑based vision models with an object‑centric inductive bias. The authors observe that existing patch‑mixing mechanisms—self‑attention, feed‑forward MLPs, and convolutional mixers—treat all patches uniformly, thereby ignoring the intrinsic scene structure defined by objects. OAMixer addresses this gap by computing a data‑specific re‑weighting mask from patch‑wise object labels, which are obtained in an unsupervised or weakly‑supervised fashion, thus avoiding additional human annotation costs. The mask modulates the interaction matrix of any patch‑mixing layer via a learnable scale parameter, strengthening intra‑object communications while attenuating inter‑object and background connections. This simple yet principled alteration can be applied to any transformer‑style architecture, including ViTs, MLP‑Mixers, and ConvMixers, without redesigning the underlying network.\n\nMethodologically, the approach proceeds in two stages. First, object labels y∈ℝ^{N×K} (with K object classes) are assigned to each of the N patches; a similarity function d(·,·) computes pairwise distances between label vectors, and a mask M_{ij}=exp(‑κ_l·d(y_i,y_j)) is formed, where κ_l≥0 is a layer‑wise learnable scalar initialized to zero. Second, the original mixing operator L_mix (self‑attention, linear MLP, or convolution) is element‑wise multiplied by M, and the result is renormalized to preserve the stochastic nature of attention matrices. The authors instantiate OAMixer for three representative mixers: (i) self‑attention, where M rescales the attention matrix before softmax; (ii) feed‑forward layers, where M is applied to the linear projection; and (iii) depth‑wise convolution, where M modifies the Toeplitz representation of the kernel. Experiments on ImageNet‑1K demonstrate consistent gains across backbones: DeiT‑B improves from 78.45% to 82.18% top‑1 accuracy (+3.73%), and linear probing on DINO‑pretrained DeiT‑T rises from 59.37% to 61.16% (+1.79%). Moreover, OAMixer enhances background robustness, outperforms spatial‑bias methods such as ConViT and TokenLabeling, and yields benefits on downstream tasks including self‑supervised learning and multi‑object recognition. Ablation studies reveal that lower layers tend to learn larger κ values (focusing on intra‑object relations), while higher layers adopt smaller κ, mirroring the hierarchical feature integration of CNNs.\n\nDespite its promise, OAMixer exhibits several limitations. The reliance on patch‑level object labels, even when sourced from unsupervised saliency detectors, introduces a dependency on the quality of external label generators; noisy or biased labels can propagate errors into the mask and degrade performance. The current formulation assumes a single dominant object per patch, which may be insufficient for highly overlapping or transparent objects, limiting applicability to complex scenes. Moreover, the scalar κ_l controls mask intensity uniformly across all channel dimensions, potentially restricting finer‑grained modulation of feature interactions. Computationally, the pairwise similarity computation scales quadratically with the number of patches, posing memory challenges for high‑resolution inputs. Finally, the paper evaluates primarily on image classification; broader validation on detection, segmentation, or video domains is absent, leaving open questions about the generality of object‑aware mixing beyond static images. Future work could explore adaptive, multi‑label masks, efficient approximations of the similarity matrix, and integration with task‑specific heads to fully leverage object‑aware inductive bias across vision tasks.\n",
            "pros_cons": "- **Generic applicability**: OAMixer is designed as a plug‑in that can be attached to any patch‑based model (ViT, MLP‑Mixer, ConvMixer) regardless of the specific mixing operation (self‑attention, feed‑forward, convolution), making the contribution broadly useful.\n- **Object‑aware inductive bias without extra manual labeling**: The method leverages object labels obtained from unsupervised or weakly‑supervised detectors, avoiding costly human annotation while still injecting semantic structure into the model.\n- **Simple and lightweight integration**: The core operation is a re‑weighting mask multiplied element‑wise with the existing mixing matrix, plus a learnable scalar per layer. This incurs minimal architectural changes and can be implemented with a few lines of code.\n- **Consistent empirical gains across tasks**: Experiments report improvements in (i) large‑scale ImageNet classification (+3.73% top‑1 for DeiT‑B), (ii) self‑supervised linear probing (+1.79% on ImageNet), (iii) background robustness and multi‑object recognition, demonstrating the method’s versatility.\n- **Complementarity with existing bias‑injection methods**: OAMixer can be combined with spatial‑bias techniques such as ConViT or CoAtNet, yielding additive performance boosts, which indicates the orthogonal nature of object‑aware and spatial inductive biases.\n- **Clear motivation and theoretical framing**: The paper formalises the mixing layer as a linear operator and shows how the mask modifies the interaction matrix, providing an interpretable view of how intra‑object and inter‑object relations are emphasized.\n- **Extensive ablation on mask scale and layer depth**: Analysis of the learned mask‑scale parameter κ(l) reveals sensible behavior (higher values in lower layers, lower values in higher layers), supporting the claim that OAMixer first focuses on intra‑object relations then expands to inter‑object context.\n\n- **Dependence on the quality of pseudo object labels**: The approach assumes that unsupervised/weakly‑supervised detectors produce sufficiently accurate patch‑level object tags. In domains where such detectors fail, the re‑weighting mask may be noisy and could degrade performance.\n- **Additional computational and memory overhead**: Computing an N×N similarity mask for each image (especially for high‑resolution inputs) adds O(N²) cost and memory, which may limit scalability to very large token counts.\n- **Limited evaluation on diverse data regimes**: The paper focuses mainly on ImageNet‑scale image classification and a few downstream tasks. It provides little evidence on low‑resource settings, domain shift scenarios, or non‑image modalities (e.g., video, multimodal data).\n- **Hyper‑parameter sensitivity not fully explored**: The choice of distance function d(·,·), the initialization of κ(l), and the temperature‑like scaling factor are introduced but not thoroughly examined for robustness across architectures.\n- **Potential redundancy with existing spatial bias methods**: While the authors claim orthogonality, the gains over strong spatial‑bias baselines (e.g., ConViT) are modest, raising questions about whether the object‑aware mask offers substantial new information beyond spatial proximity.\n- **Lack of qualitative analysis of failure cases**: The paper shows visualizations of the mask but does not discuss scenarios where OAMixer harms performance, which is important for understanding its limits.\n- **Scalability to video or sequential data is unaddressed**: Although the authors mention video as a future direction, the current formulation does not consider temporal consistency of object masks, limiting immediate applicability to video Transformers.\n- **Complexity of integrating with pre‑trained models**: When applying OAMixer to already pre‑trained checkpoints, fine‑tuning may be required to adapt the mask parameters, adding an extra training step that could be prohibitive in practice.\n"

            "paper_id": "PatchRot_ A Self-Supervised Technique for Training Vision Transformers",
            "summary": "The paper introduces PatchRot, a self‑supervised pre‑training scheme explicitly designed for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Recognizing that existing self‑supervised tasks such as RotNet and Jigsaw were conceived for convolutional networks and that ViTs process images as sequences of patches, the authors propose to predict rotation angles at two hierarchical levels: the whole image and each individual patch. By leveraging the class token for global rotation prediction and attaching auxiliary multilayer‑perceptron (MLP) heads to the token embeddings of every patch, PatchRot forces the backbone to encode both global semantics and fine‑grained local structure, thereby addressing the data‑hungry nature of ViTs.\n\nMethodologically, the authors formalize a rotation operator \\(R(\\cdot;\\iota)\\) with \\(\\iota \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\) corresponding to multiples of 90°. For each training sample they either rotate the entire image or rotate each patch independently, sampling patch rotations uniformly. The ViT processes the resulting token sequence, and the class token output is fed to an MLP \\(M_0\\) that predicts the image‑level angle, while each patch token passes through a dedicated MLP \\(M_i\\) to predict its local rotation. The overall loss is the sum of cross‑entropy terms over image and patch predictions (Eq. 1). To avoid trivial cues from edge continuity, a buffer gap \\(B\\) is introduced: patches are extracted from a larger region and then cropped, creating random gaps between patches. Training is performed on reduced‑resolution inputs (e.g., 24×24 for CIFAR‑10) with a standard Adam optimizer, cosine‑annealed learning rate, and effective batch size multiplied by five due to the multiple rotated variants per image.\n\nEmpirical evaluation on CIFAR‑10/100, FashionMNIST and Tiny‑ImageNet using a ViT‑Lite architecture demonstrates that PatchRot consistently outperforms both fully supervised training and RotNet. In particular, an ablation on CIFAR‑10 shows a top‑1 accuracy increase from 91.8 % (supervised) to 92.6 % when the full PatchRot pipeline is employed, and the method yields superior fine‑tuning performance across all encoder layers. Visualizations of attention maps suggest that the model learns more discriminative spatial patterns after PatchRot pre‑training.\n\nDespite these gains, the study exhibits several limitations. First, experiments are confined to small‑scale datasets and a down‑scaled ViT, leaving open the question of scalability to large‑resolution benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet‑1k) and deeper transformer variants. Second, the reliance on a fixed set of four rotation angles may restrict the richness of the supervisory signal; more diverse geometric transformations could further enhance representation learning. Third, the buffer‑gap strategy reduces the effective image area and may introduce distribution shift when transferring to full‑resolution downstream tasks, a bias not quantified in the paper. Finally, the additional patch‑wise MLP heads increase memory consumption during pre‑training, which could be prohibitive for high‑resolution inputs.\n\nFuture work should explore (i) extending PatchRot to multi‑angle or continuous rotation spaces, (ii) integrating it with other self‑supervised objectives (e.g., contrastive learning) to capture complementary invariances, (iii) evaluating on large‑scale vision benchmarks and transformer backbones, and (iv) devising more efficient implementations that mitigate the overhead of per‑patch heads while preserving the dual‑level supervision.\n",

            "paper_id": "Vicinity Vision Transformer",
            "summary": "Recent advances in vision transformers have been hampered by the quadratic complexity of softmax‑based self‑attention, which limits their applicability to high‑resolution imagery. Sun et al. (2015) address this bottleneck by introducing Vicinity Vision Transformer (VVT), a linear‑complexity backbone that explicitly incorporates a 2‑D locality bias into the attention mechanism. The core contribution is Vicinity Attention, a linear attention formulation that re‑weights pairwise interactions using a cosine‑modulated Manhattan distance between patches. By decomposing the distance term into row‑ and column‑wise components, the authors retain linear time and memory costs with respect to the number of tokens while encouraging stronger connections among spatially proximate patches. To mitigate the residual quadratic dependence on feature dimension, they propose the Vicinity Attention Block, which consists of Feature Reduction Attention (FRA) that halves the channel dimension before attention, and a Feature Preserving Connection (FPC) that restores the original distribution via a lightweight skip path. This block reduces the overall theoretical complexity to \\(O(N(2d)^2 + 2d^2)\\), where \\(N\\) is the token count and \\(d\\) the embedding size.\n\nVVT is instantiated as a four‑stage pyramid network, each stage comprising a patch‑embedding layer followed by multiple Vicinity Transformer blocks. Variants (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large) span 12–62 M parameters and are evaluated on CIFAR‑100, ImageNet‑1k, and ADE20K. Across these benchmarks VVT consistently outperforms prior transformer‑based and convolutional backbones: on ImageNet‑1k VVT‑L achieves 84.1 % top‑1 accuracy with 61.8 M parameters, a 0.3 % gain over the best existing linear transformer while using ~50 % fewer parameters. On ADE20K semantic segmentation, VVT‑L attains 48.8 % mIoU, surpassing Swin‑B and Twins‑L with comparable FLOPs. Ablation studies demonstrate that (i) 2‑D locality yields a 6 % absolute improvement over 1‑D locality or no locality, (ii) FRA alone reduces GFLOPs by ~30 % with negligible accuracy loss, and (iii) FPC recovers a 0.5 % accuracy boost after dimensionality reduction. The authors also report favorable memory growth rates, noting that VVT’s linear attention scales more gracefully than Performer, Linformer, or Quadtree‑based methods.\n\nDespite these strengths, several limitations merit discussion. First, the locality bias is encoded via a handcrafted Manhattan distance and cosine weighting, which may not optimally capture anisotropic visual relationships or adapt to irregular object shapes; learning a data‑driven positional kernel could improve flexibility. Second, while FRA curtails the quadratic term in feature dimension, the residual \\(O(d^2)\\) component can still dominate for very deep models or when scaling to extremely high‑resolution inputs, as evidenced by out‑of‑memory failures at 512×512 resolution for some baselines. Third, the pyramid design relies on fixed patch sizes and reduction ratios, potentially limiting the method’s applicability to tasks requiring fine‑grained spatial precision (e.g., dense pose estimation). Fourth, the experimental suite focuses primarily on classification and semantic segmentation; robustness to domain shift, occlusion, or adversarial perturbations remains unexplored. Finally, the codebase is publicly released but the paper does not provide a thorough analysis of training stability or hyper‑parameter sensitivity, leaving open the risk of brittle convergence in different hardware settings. Future work could address these issues by learning adaptive locality functions, integrating hierarchical attention across scales, and extending evaluation to broader vision tasks and robustness benchmarks.\n",

Its primary goal is to chart the chronological development of FPV methodologies, to catalogue the most frequently employed visual features and algorithmic strategies, and to contextualise these advances within the rapid emergence of wearable recording devices such as action cameras and smart‑glasses. The authors contribute a comprehensive taxonomy that organises the literature according to (i) hardware categories (head‑mounted cameras, smart‑glasses, multimodal wearables), (ii) feature families (color, texture, motion, shape, hand‑centric cues), and (iii) application domains (object detection, activity recognition, user‑machine interaction). In addition, the survey compiles publicly available FPV datasets, summarises their acquisition conditions, and highlights the scarcity of standardized benchmarks.\n\nMethodologically, the authors conduct an exhaustive literature search across major computer‑vision venues, extracting 150+ papers that explicitly address FPV video processing. Publication trends are visualised (Fig. 1) to demonstrate a steep increase in output following the introduction of commercial smart‑glasses prototypes in the early 2010s. The survey tabulates hardware specifications (sensor types, field‑of‑view, battery constraints) and aligns them with algorithmic choices, revealing a shift from handcrafted feature pipelines toward hybrid systems that combine motion‑based descriptors (e.g., optical flow) with hand‑detection heuristics for activity inference. Key empirical observations include the dominance of motion cues for egocentric activity segmentation, the growing relevance of hand‑region analysis for object manipulation tasks, and the nascent attempts at real‑time processing enabled by the computational capabilities of modern wearables.\n\nDespite its breadth, the study exhibits several limitations. First, the temporal scope ends in 2014, thereby excluding the recent surge of deep‑learning approaches that have since reshaped FPV research; this restricts the survey's relevance to contemporary method development. Second, the reliance on published academic papers introduces a selection bias, potentially overlooking industrial contributions and proprietary datasets that could alter the perceived feature‑method landscape. Third, the hardware overview, while detailed for the surveyed period, rapidly becomes outdated given the accelerated evolution of sensor miniaturisation, power‑efficient processors, and augmented‑reality displays. Fourth, performance comparisons across studies are largely qualitative, as the authors note the absence of unified evaluation protocols, which hampers objective assessment of methodological progress.\n\nThe authors conclude by outlining future research directions: the establishment of common benchmark suites and evaluation metrics; integration of deep neural architectures for end‑to‑end egocentric perception; systematic treatment of privacy, battery life, and user comfort constraints; and the exploitation of multimodal sensor fusion (e.g., inertial, audio, eye‑tracking) to enrich context understanding.

Positional embeddings are added and an **extra scan‑age token** encodes the subject’s age.\n- **Training regimes:** Three regimes were explored – (1) training from scratch, (2) ImageNet‑pre‑training, and (3) self‑supervised **masked‑patch‑prediction (MPP)** pre‑training. **MPP yielded the best performance**.\n- **Results:** On the dHCP neonatal dataset, **SiT‑small with MPP** achieved MAE = 0.85 weeks for gestational age (GA) and MAE = 1.12 weeks for post‑menstrual age (PMA), outperforming the strongest geometric‑DL baseline (MoNet, MAE ≈ 1.05 weeks) and showing reduced degradation on unregistered data. Adding the scan‑age token further improved GA prediction.\n\n### Glance‑and‑Gaze Transformer (GG‑Transformer)\n- **Dual‑branch block:** *Glance* branch performs self‑attention on adaptively dilated partitions (linear‑size attention), while *Gaze* branch adds a lightweight depth‑wise convolution to capture fine‑grained interactions across partition boundaries.

    "SOTA_no_judge": "Gaps in SOTA: High-Impact Research Opportunities\n- **Topology‑agnostic Surface Transformers**: *Research Question*: How can we design vision‑transformer architectures that operate directly on arbitrary‑genus meshes without requiring spherical projection? *Justification*: The Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) is limited to genus‑zero surfaces, and spherical mapping introduces geometric distortion, restricting applicability to cortical data and excluding many biomedical meshes (e.g., cardiac, protein structures). A topology‑agnostic approach (e.g., intrinsic graph‑based attention, spectral positional encodings) would close this methodological gap and broaden the impact of transformer models across 3‑D biomedical domains.\n- **Multi‑scale Hierarchical Patching for Non‑Euclidean and Euclidean Vision Transformers**: *Research Question*: Can a unified multi‑resolution patching scheme—combining adaptive quadrangle, spherical, and regular tessellations—be integrated with transformer attention to capture fine‑to‑coarse patterns on surfaces and images? *Justification*: Multiple papers (SiT, Quadrangle Attention, Glance‑and‑Gaze) evaluate only a single patch scale or fixed regular tessellation, missing hierarchical context that is crucial for highly folded cortical regions and objects of varying size. Introducing learnable, scale‑varying patches would address the noted lack of multi‑scale modeling and improve both accuracy and computational efficiency.\n- **Domain‑Specific Self‑Supervised Pre‑training for Geometric Data**: *Research Question*: What self‑supervised objectives (e.g., masked‑surface modeling, geometric rotation prediction, contrastive mesh embeddings) can be devised to pre‑train transformers on large, unlabeled collections of medical surfaces and volumetric scans? *Justification*: Current works rely on ImageNet pre‑training (a natural‑image domain gap) or limited small‑scale datasets, and the benefit of domain‑specific pre‑training remains unexplored. Developing geometry‑aware pre‑training will mitigate data scarcity, reduce over‑fitting, and unlock higher performance on downstream biomedical regression and classification tasks.\n- **Built‑in Equivariance and Deformation Invariance for Vision Transformers**: *Research Question*: How can rotational, reflectional, and elastic equivariance be embedded into transformer attention mechanisms (e.g., equivariant positional encodings, invariant query/key projections) to replace ad‑hoc augmentations? *Justification*: Several papers report reliance on limited rotation augmentations, sensitivity to input resolution, and absence of formal equivariance analysis. An architecture that is mathematically equivariant would improve robustness, simplify training pipelines, and provide a theoretical foundation missing from current studies.\n- **Unified Theoretical Framework for Projection‑Induced Biases and Attention Expressivity**: *Research Question*: What is the formal impact of surface projection (spherical, icosahedral, quadrangular) and attention design choices on model expressivity, inductive bias, and generalization in non‑Euclidean vision transformers? *Justification*: Many works acknowledge but do not analytically investigate how projection distortion, patch geometry, and attention complexity affect learning. A rigorous theory would guide principled architecture design, explain empirical gaps, and set performance bounds for future models.\n",

The core innovation is a **patching pipeline**:\n1. Genus‑zero cortical meshes are projected onto a regularly tessellated icosphere.\n2. The sphere is divided into equal‑area triangular patches.\n3. Each patch is flattened into a token and fed to a standard transformer encoder.\n4. A learnable token representing the target variable and sinusoidal positional embeddings are appended, allowing the model to operate on both template‑aligned and native (unregistered) surfaces without explicit rotational bias.\n\n**Model Variants**  \nTwo lightweight ViT back‑bones—DeiT‑Tiny and DeiT‑Small—are adapted, yielding **SiT‑tiny** (5.5 M parameters) and **SiT‑small** (21.6 M parameters).\n\n**Training Strategies**  \n1. Training from scratch.  \n2. Initialising from ImageNet‑pretrained weights (via the *timm* library).  \n3. Self‑supervised pre‑training with a **masked‑patch‑prediction (MPP)** task inspired by BERT, where 50 % of patches are corrupted and the model learns to reconstruct them (MSE loss on masked patches only).\n\n**Dataset & Tasks**  \nExperiments use neonatal cortical surfaces from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Four surface metrics (sulcal depth, curvature, thickness, T1w/T2w ratio) are provided for 588 subjects (term and preterm). Two regression tasks are evaluated:\n* **Post‑menstrual age at scan (PMA)**\n* **Gestational age at birth (GA)**\n\n**Methodological Details**  \n* Class‑imbalance (more term than preterm neonates) is addressed by **sampling during training** to obtain balanced batches.  \n* **Rotation and dropout augmentations** markedly improve GA prediction performance, while they do not noticeably affect PMA results.\n\n**Results**  \n| Model | Pre‑training | MAE (weeks) – PMA (template / native) | MAE (weeks) – GA (template / native) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| SiT‑small | MPP | **0.55 / 0.63** (average ≈ 0.59) | **1.02 / 1.21** (average ≈ 1.12) |\n| SiT‑small | ImageNet | 0.59 / 0.71 | 1.13 / 1.30 |\n| SiT‑tiny | MPP | 0.58 / 0.64 | 1.03 / 1.31 |\n| SiT‑tiny | ImageNet | 0.67 / 0.70 | 1.11 / 1.20 |\n\nThe **MoNet** baseline reported in the original comparison attains **MAE = 0.57 / 0.61 weeks for the PMA task**, not for GA as previously misstated.  \nAcross all configurations SiT achieves comparable or lower errors than the best surface CNNs (S2CNN, GConvNet, ChebNet) and shows **smaller performance degradation on unregistered data**, indicating a degree of transformation invariance.\n\n**Limitations & Future Directions**  \n* The spherical projection confines the method to **genus‑zero manifolds**, limiting use on surfaces with holes or branching topology.  \n* A fixed patch size may discard fine‑grained geometric detail, especially in high‑curvature regions.  \n* The encoder is a vanilla ViT; incorporating hierarchical or local‑global attention, learned manifold‑aware positional encodings, or other recent transformer enhancements could improve efficiency and expressivity.  \n* Pre‑training is limited to ImageNet and a single MPP task; broader self‑supervised objectives (e.g., contrastive learning) on large medical‑surface collections may yield more robust representations.  \n* Evaluation is restricted to neonatal cortical phenotypes; extending to other biomedical meshes (e.g., cardiac, protein) would test generalisability.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe Surface Vision Transformer demonstrates that vision‑transformer architectures, when coupled with a simple spherical patching scheme, can surpass existing geometric deep‑learning methods for cortical surface analysis, offering robustness to registration variations and modest transformation invariance while retaining the flexibility of a sequence‑based model.\n",

            "summary": "## Glance‑and‑Gaze Vision Transformer (GG‑Transformer)\n\n**Problem & Motivation** – Vanilla self‑attention has quadratic complexity with respect to the token sequence length, which becomes prohibitive for high‑resolution vision tasks that require dense predictions. Inspired by human perception—quickly *glancing* the whole scene while *gazing* at local details—the authors propose a dual‑branch Transformer block that preserves the global modeling strength of Transformers while keeping computation linear.\n\n**Architecture**\n- **Glance branch**: the input feature map is split into *adaptively‑dilated partitions* (each partition samples tokens from the entire image with a dilation rate proportional to the spatial size). Self‑attention is performed independently within each partition, giving a global receptive field but only **O(N)** complexity (the same order as Swin‑Transformer’s window attention).\n- **Gaze branch**: after the partitions are merged back, a lightweight **depth‑wise convolution** (fixed 3×3 or an adaptive kernel whose size matches the dilation) injects local context that the Glance branch cannot capture.\n- The two streams are merged, yielding output features of the same spatial resolution as the input.\n\n**Integration** – The proposed **GG‑MSA** replaces the standard multi‑head self‑attention (MSA) in hierarchical Vision Transformers. It is evaluated in two settings:\n1. **Swin‑style backbones** – GG‑Transformer families **GG‑T** and **GG‑S** are built to match the parameter and FLOP budgets of Swin‑T and Swin‑S respectively (M = 7, expansion ratio 4). \n2. **DeiT backbones** – Replacing MSA with GG‑MSA in DeiT‑T and DeiT‑S improves top‑1 ImageNet accuracy by **+1.6 %** (DeiT‑T) and **+0.6 %** (DeiT‑S).\n\n**Experimental Results**\n- **ImageNet‑1K classification** (single 224×224 crop):\n  - GG‑T: 82.0 % top‑1 (28 M params, 4.5 G FLOPs) – +0.8 % over Swin‑T.\n  - GG‑S: 83.4 % top‑1 (50 M params, 8.7 G FLOPs) – +0.2 % over Swin‑S.\n- **ADE20K semantic segmentation** (UperNet backbone):\n  - GG‑T: 46.4 % mIoU (single‑scale), surpassing ResNet‑50, PVT‑Small and Swin‑T (multi‑scale) by 3.6 %, 1.6 %, and 0.6 % respectively.\n  - GG‑S: 48.4 % mIoU, comparable to the larger Swin‑S.\n- **COCO object detection & instance segmentation** (Mask R‑CNN & Cascaded Mask R‑CNN):\n  - GG‑T: box AP 44.1 (↑0.4) and mask AP 39.9 (↑0.1) over Swin‑T.\n  - GG‑S: box AP 45.7 (↑0.3) and mask AP 41.3 (↑0.1) over Swin‑S.\n\n**Ablation Studies** –\n- Both Glance and Gaze branches are essential; Glance‑only or Gaze‑only variants drop 3–4 % in top‑1 accuracy.\n- Depth‑wise convolution for the Gaze branch outperforms a self‑attention‑based Gaze (‑1.21 % lower), while still fitting within the same computational budget.\n- Fixed vs. adaptive Gaze kernels give similar results; the adaptive setting is used in the final design.\n\n**Limitations** – GG‑Transformer still inherits the data‑efficiency challenges of Vision Transformers (over‑fitting on smaller datasets), may struggle with extreme aspect‑ratio images due to the uniform dilation scheme, and relies on fixed‑size positional encodings that can degrade when testing on resolutions far from training.\n\n**Code & Models** – The authors will make the implementation and pretrained checkpoints publicly available at **https://github.com/yucornetto/GG-Transformer**.\n\n**Conclusion** – By jointly modeling long‑range dependencies (Glance) and fine‑grained locality (Gaze) in a single, linear‑complexity block, GG‑Transformer achieves consistent accuracy gains over state‑of‑the‑art CNN and Transformer baselines across classification, segmentation, and detection, while keeping computational costs comparable to existing efficient Transformers.\n",

            "summary": "## Summary of *ViTAEv2: Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring Inductive Bias for Image Recognition and Beyond* (Zhang et al., 2022)\n\n### Core Idea\n- Vision transformers (ViTs) lack the **locality** and **scale‑invariance** inductive biases (IBs) that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) possess.  As a result, vanilla ViTs need massive datasets and long training schedules to **implicitly** learn these properties.\n- **ViTAEv2** introduces the two IBs **explicitly** by designing two elementary cells that can be stacked **isotropically** (same pattern) or in a **multi‑stage** fashion (ViTAEv2).  The design follows a *divide‑and‑conquer* principle: local‑ and multi‑scale processing is performed in parallel with the global self‑attention mechanism.\n\n### Architecture\n| Cell | Main Components | Function |\n|------|----------------|----------|\n| **Reduction Cell (RC)** | Pyramid Reduction Module (PRM) – atrous convolutions with dilation sets **S₁=[1,2,3,4]**, **S₂=[1,2,3]**, **S₃=[1,2]**; down‑sampling ratios 4×, 2×, 2× | Embeds **multi‑scale context** while reducing spatial resolution. |\n| **Normal Cell (NC)** | Parallel Convolutional Module (PCM) – three 3×3 conv layers with **BN** and **SiLU**; followed by Multi‑Head Self‑Attention (MHSA) and Feed‑Forward Network (FFN) | Captures **local patterns** (via PCM) before the **global dependency** (via MHSA). |\n\n- **Fusion strategies**: *early* (PCM + MHSA fused **before** FFN) and *late* (fused **after** FFN).  Early fusion with BN consistently yields the best ImageNet top‑1 (≈69.9 %).\n- **Attention types per stage** (ViTAEv2‑S as an example): `W, W, F, F` – window attention in the first two stages, full attention in the last two.  This reduces memory (e.g., 28 GB → 27 GB for 224×224 images) while keeping accuracy (~82.6 %).\n- The multi‑stage backbone (ViTAEv2‑S) arranges **RC → (NC × N)** across **four stages**, each stage using a possibly different attention type (`P` = Performer, `W` = window, `F` = full).  The default setting is **`W, W, F, F`**.\n\n### Training & Scaling\n| Model | Parameters | Training regime | ImageNet‑1K top‑1 | ImageNet‑Real top‑1 |\n|-------|------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **ViTAE‑H** (isotropic) | 644 M | Supervised on ImageNet‑1K | **88.5 %** | **91.2 %** (no private data) |\n| **ViTAE‑B** (MAE‑pre‑trained) | 89.7 M | MAE self‑supervised (75 % mask) + fine‑tune | 84.8 % | 89.9 % top‑5 |\n| **ViTAE‑L** (MAE‑pre‑trained) | 311 M | Same as above | 86.0 % | – |\n| **ViTAEv2‑S** (multi‑stage) | 19.2 M | Trained on only **5 %** of ImageNet‑1K | **82.6 %** (demonstrates strong data efficiency) | – |\n\n### Downstream Performance\n- **Object Detection (MS‑COCO)** – using **Mask RCNN** and **Cascade RCNN** as decoders:\n  - *ViTAEv2‑S* (Mask RCNN): **46.3 % APᵇ**, 68.8 % AP₅₀ᵇ, 51.0 % AP₇₅ᵇ.\n  - *ViTAEv2‑S* (Cascade RCNN, 3× schedule): **50.6 % APᵇ**, 69.9 % AP₅₀ᵇ, 54.9 % AP₇₅ᵇ.\n  - These results surpass ResNet‑50, Swin‑T and several recent transformer backbones.\n\n- **Semantic Segmentation (ADE20K)** – UperNet framework:\n  - Single‑scale input: **45.0 % mIoU** (ViTAEv2‑S) vs. ResNet‑50 (42.1 %) and Swin‑T (44.5 %).\n  - Multi‑scale testing: **48.0 % mIoU**, beating all compared backbones.\n\n- **Animal Pose Estimation (AP‑10K)** – simple baseline (SimPLEBaseline) with ViTAEv2‑S (23.1 M):\n  - **AP 0.718**, **AP₅₀ 0.923**, **AP₇₅ 0.786**, outperforming ResNet‑50 and Swin‑T (both lower across all metrics).\n\n### Ablation Findings\n- **Early PCM‑MHSA fusion + BN** improves top‑1 by ~0.5 % compared with late fusion.\n- **Smaller dilation rates** in deeper RCs (using the ↓ schedule) give better accuracy than larger rates (e.g., 4 or 5) which can produce overly smooth features.\n- **Window attention** in early stages cuts memory (e.g., 28 GB → 27 GB for 224×224) and speeds up training (≈+5 % images/s) while retaining ~82.6 % top‑1.\n- **Convolutional kernel size**: using 3×3 kernels in PCM during fine‑tuning yields a marginal 0.1 % top‑1 gain and a 56 % memory reduction at 896×896 resolution.\n\n### Limitations Highlighted by the Authors\n1. **Complexity & Inference Cost** – The parallel convolution‑attention pipelines increase architectural complexity and make inference **10–20 % slower** than a pure ViT‑S, especially on high‑resolution inputs (≈896×896).\n2. **Hyper‑parameter Sensitivity** – While several dilation‑rate schedules are examined, the summary notes that the **sensitivity** of performance to these rates is not fully explored, leaving robustness to other datasets uncertain.\n3. **Data‑Hungry Still** – Large models (e.g., ViTAE‑H) still profit from **MAE self‑supervised pre‑training** and from fine‑tuning on **ImageNet‑22K** to surpass 91 % top‑1, indicating the introduced IBs do **not** completely eliminate the data‑hungry nature of transformers.\n4. **Scope of Evaluation** – Experiments are limited to **image‑centric** tasks; no video, video‑text, or other multimodal benchmarks are presented, so the generality of RC/NC cells to other modalities remains untested.\n5. **Robustness Evaluation** – Robustness is measured only against **ℓ∞ adversarial attacks**; the paper does not assess resilience to common corruptions, distribution shifts, occlusions, or other realistic perturbations.\n\n### Future Work (as suggested by the authors)\n- **Hardware‑friendly design**: simplify the parallel PCM‑MHSA structure for devices lacking efficient concurrent convolution‑attention kernels.\n- **Automated IB selection**: develop methods to automatically choose dilation‑rate schedules or kernel sizes per dataset.\n- **Temporal / Multimodal Extension**: explore how the reduction and normal cells can be adapted for video or vision‑language models.\n- **Broader Robustness Studies**: evaluate against corruption benchmarks, domain shifts, and occlusion to better understand practical robustness.\n- **New IBs**: investigate other intrinsic or learnable inductive biases (e.g., viewpoint invariance) to further close the performance gap between transformers and CNNs.\n\n---\n*All figures, percentages, and model sizes are taken directly from the original manuscript and its tables; no external information has been introduced.*\n",

            "summary": "### Evo‑ViT: Slow‑Fast Token Evolution for Dynamic Vision Transformers\n\n**Paper reference**: Yifan Xu *et al.* (2022)\n\n#### Motivation\nVision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance but incur a quadratic computational cost with respect to the input token sequence length. Existing acceleration approaches either (1) **structured spatial compression**, which reduces the resolution of feature maps, or (2) **unstructured token pruning**, which drops tokens deemed redundant. Token pruning suffers from two main drawbacks: (i) it destroys the spatial structure required by many modern *deep‑narrow* transformers, and (ii) it typically needs a costly pre‑training step before pruning can be applied.\n\n#### Core Idea – Slow‑Fast Token Evolution\nEvo‑ViT proposes a **self‑motivated** framework that can be applied **from scratch** to both *flat* (e.g., DeiT) and *deep‑narrow* (e.g., LeViT) ViTs. The method consists of two tightly coupled components:\n\n1. **Structure‑preserving token selection**\n   * The native **class token attention** (CLS‑attention) is used to score each patch token.\n   * An **evolved global class attention** is computed across layers (Eq. 4) to obtain a more stable importance signal.\n   * Tokens whose scores rank in the top‑k are kept as **informative (object) tokens**; the remaining tokens become **placeholder tokens**.\n   * Crucially, placeholder tokens are **preserved** rather than removed, thus maintaining the full spatial layout.\n\n2. **Slow‑fast updating**\n   * **Informative tokens** are updated through the standard full ViT pipeline (MSA + FFN) – the **slow** path.\n   * All placeholder tokens are first **aggregated** into a single **representative token** (Eq. 5). This token is evolved by the same MSA + FFN blocks, producing residuals.\n   * The residuals are **broadcast** back to every placeholder token (Eq. 7), providing a **fast** update that incurs negligible extra cost.\n\n#### Training Strategy\n* A **layer‑to‑stage schedule** gradually introduces token selection and slow‑fast updating: token selection is performed from the 5th (or 9th) encoder layer onward for the first 200 epochs; in the final 100 epochs only the selection at the beginning of each stage is kept, while updating continues in every layer.\n* An **auxiliary CLS‑token loss** is added to the usual classification loss to stabilise the class‑attention signal.\n\n#### Experiments\n* **Datasets & models** – ImageNet‑1K classification using DeiT (flat) and LeViT (deep‑narrow) backbones.\n* **Efficiency** – Evo‑ViT accelerates DeiT‑S by **over 60 % throughput** (from 2 536 to 4 027 images / s) with only a **0.4 % drop** in top‑1 accuracy (72.0 % → 71.6 %). Similar gains are observed on LeViT variants.\n* **Comparison** – Against token‑pruning baselines (DynamicViT, PS‑ViT, SViTE) Evo‑ViT attains comparable or higher top‑1 accuracy while delivering **larger throughput improvements**.

            "paper_id": "Vision Transformer with Quadrangle Attention",
            "summary": "## Summary\n\n**Vision Transformer with Quadrangle Attention**\n\nZhang *et al.* propose **Quadrangle Attention (QA)**, a data‑driven extension of the widely used window‑based attention in Vision Transformers (ViTs). Instead of fixed‑size rectangular windows, QA learns a *projective transformation* for each default square window, converting it into an arbitrary quadrangle that can better align with objects of varying size, aspect ratio, and orientation. The transformation matrix is predicted by an end‑to‑end **quadrangle regression module** consisting of average‑pooling, a LeakyReLU activation and a 1×1 convolution, and is decomposed into five elementary operations: scaling + shift, shear, rotation, translation, and projection. Tokens inside the transformed quadrangle are sampled via bilinear interpolation and then processed by the standard query‑key‑value self‑attention pipeline. A regularization term (weight λ, set to 1 in the experiments) penalizes quadrangles that fall largely outside the feature map, stabilising training; extreme λ values cause divergence.\n\n### Computational Overhead\n- The extra cost comes from the bilinear sampling, which is **O(4·H·W·C)**, i.e., less than **5 %** of the total FLOPs of a Swin‑style transformer.\n- Only minor code modifications are required.\n- On an NVIDIA A100 GPU the inference speed slows by about **13 %** compared with Swin‑Transformer, mainly because the sampling kernels are not yet fully optimised.\n\n### Architecture Integration\nQA is integrated into both **plain** (ViT‑based) and **hierarchical** (Swin‑style) backbones, yielding the **QFormer** family (QFormer‑p for plain, QFormer‑h for hierarchical). The design permits interleaving QA layers with occasional full‑attention layers; experiments show that QA consistently outperforms window‑based attention even when a few full‑attention layers are present.\n\n### Experimental Results\n| Task | Dataset | Model | Top‑1 / mAP / mIoU / AP |\n|------|---------|-------|--------------------------|\n| Classification | ImageNet‑1K | QFormerh‑B | **84.1 %** (↑0.7 % over Swin‑B) |\n| Classification | ImageNet‑1K | QFormerh‑T | 82.5 % (↑0.9 % over Swin‑T) |\n| Object Detection / Instance Segmentation | COCO (Mask‑RCNN) | QFormerh‑T | mAP⁽bb⁾ = 45.9 (+0.7), mAP⁽mk⁾ = 41.5 (+0.7) |\n| Object Detection / Instance Segmentation | COCO (Cascade‑RCNN) | QFormerh‑T (3× schedule) | mAP⁽bb⁾ = 49.8 (+0.7), mAP⁽mk⁾ = 43.0 (+0.7) |\n| Semantic Segmentation | ADE20K (UPerNet) | QFormerh‑T (single‑scale) | mIoU = 46.9 (+2.4) |\n| Pose Estimation | COCO (keypoints) | QFormerh‑T (full‑attention + QA) | AP = 77.2 (+0.4) |\n\nAblation studies (Table 2) demonstrate that each elementary transformation (scale‑shift, shear, rotation, projection) contributes positively; the full composition yields the highest gains (e.g., Top‑1 = 82.9 % for QFormerp‑B). QA also remains effective when combined with a few full‑attention layers, achieving the best trade‑off between accuracy and computational cost.\n\n### Qualitative Findings\n- Visualisations reveal that learned quadrangles tightly cover object extents and adapt their shape, size, and orientation to the underlying content.\n- Attention‑distance analysis shows that QA layers attend over **larger and more diverse distances** than fixed windows, confirming the claim of enhanced long‑range context modelling.\n\n### Limitations & Future Directions\n1. **Shallow regression head** – the average‑pool + LeakyReLU + 1×1‑conv predictor may limit the ability to model extreme perspective deformations; richer regressors could be explored.\n2. **Out‑of‑bounds sampling** – tokens sampled outside the feature map are zero‑padded, which can lead to sparse gradients for windows that frequently extend beyond image borders, especially at higher resolutions.\n3. **Generality** – QA has been evaluated in supervised fine‑tuning and with MAE pre‑training for plain ViTs, but its compatibility with other self‑supervised or multimodal pre‑training regimes remains untested.\n4. **Efficiency** – the bilinear sampling incurs a noticeable runtime overhead on hardware lacking specialised kernels; hardware‑aware implementations (e.g., fused CUDA kernels) could close the 13 % speed gap.\n5. **Regularization sensitivity** – the hyper‑parameter λ must be tuned carefully; too small values lead to divergence, while overly large values may over‑constrain the quadrangles.\n\n**Conclusion** – Quadrangle Attention provides a simple yet powerful mechanism to make window‑based ViTs *data‑adaptive*, achieving consistent gains across classification, detection, segmentation, and pose estimation while adding only marginal computational overhead. Addressing the identified limitations—richer regression, adaptive out‑of‑bounds handling, broader pre‑training validation, and optimized kernels—offers promising avenues for further improving QA‑enabled transformers.\n",

PatchRot addresses this by defining a **pre‑text task that exploits both global and local cues** of an image, tailored to the token‑wise processing of ViTs.\n\n### Method\n- **Pre‑text task**: Either the whole image *or* each individual patch is rotated by one of four multiples of 90° (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).  Crucially, **image rotation is *not* applied when rotating patches**, because combining both was found to degrade downstream performance.\n- **Prediction heads**:\n  - The **class token** (the classification head) predicts the rotation angle of the *entire* image.\n  - A set of **auxiliary MLP heads** attached to each patch token predicts the rotation angle of its corresponding patch.\n- **Loss**: Cross‑entropy terms for image‑rotation and for all patch‑rotations are summed (Eq. 1).\n- **Post‑training**: After the self‑supervised stage, the auxiliary patch MLP heads are **removed**; only the original classification head (and its encoder output) is retained for downstream tasks.  The \"Reuse MLP head\" variant is an ablation, not the default pipeline.\n\n### Training Setup\n- **Architecture**: ViT‑Lite (Hassani et al., 2021) – 6 encoder blocks, 256‑dimensional embeddings, 512‑dimensional feed‑forward expansion, 4 attention heads, dropout = 0.1.\n- **Patch size**: P = 4 for CIFAR‑10/100 and FashionMNIST, P = 8 for Tiny‑ImageNet.\n- **Buffer gap**: B = 14 % of the patch size, creating a random gap (0–2B px) between patches; input resolution is reduced (e.g., 24×24 for 32×32 images).\n- **Optimizer & schedule**: Adam with learning rate = 5 × 10⁻⁴, weight decay = 3 × 10⁻²; LR warmed up for 10 epochs then decayed cosine‑wise.\n- **Batch size**: 128 (effective batch size 128 × 5 due to the five rotated versions per image).\n- **Epochs**: 300 epochs for self‑supervised PatchRot pre‑training, followed by 200 epochs of supervised fine‑tuning on the downstream classification tasks.\n\n### Experimental Findings\n- PatchRot **outperforms** both a fully supervised baseline and the original RotNet on CIFAR‑10, CIFAR‑100, FashionMNIST, and Tiny‑ImageNet, especially when deeper encoder layers are fine‑tuned.\n- **Ablation studies** confirm that joint supervision of image‑ and patch‑rotations is essential; the \"Reuse MLP head\" variant yields slightly lower performance than the default pipeline that discards the patch heads after pre‑training.\n- Visualizations of attention maps show that PatchRot‑trained ViTs attend to broader object regions, indicating richer feature learning.\n\n### Limitations & Future Directions\n- Evaluation is limited to small‑scale datasets and the lightweight ViT‑Lite; scalability to larger ViTs (ViT‑Base/‑Large) and high‑resolution ImageNet‑level tasks remains untested.\n- The pre‑text task uses only discrete 90° rotations, potentially biasing representations toward orientation‑specific features.\n- The buffer‑gap cropping reduces effective resolution, which might hinder dense prediction tasks (e.g., segmentation).\n- Added MLP heads increase memory usage during pre‑training; comparative computational costs against methods such as DINO or MAE are not reported.\n- Robustness to distribution shift or adversarial perturbations is not explored.\n\n**Future work** should examine PatchRot’s applicability to larger ViTs and datasets, incorporate more varied geometric transformations, evaluate on detection/segmentation downstream tasks, and provide thorough analyses of computational efficiency and robustness.\n",

            "summary": "The Vicinity Vision Transformer (VVT) paper addresses the prohibitive quadratic complexity of conventional softmax attention in vision transformers, which limits their applicability to high‑resolution images. The authors identify that existing linear‑attention schemes, originally devised for natural language processing, neglect a critical inductive bias in visual data: two‑dimensional (2D) locality. To remedy this, they propose Vicinity Attention, a linear‑attention mechanism that integrates 2D Manhattan‑distance based re‑weighting, ensuring that spatially neighboring patches receive stronger attention while preserving global context. A novel Vicinity Attention Block (VAB) is introduced to alleviate the quadratic dependence on feature dimension inherent to linear attention. VAB comprises a Feature Reduction Attention (FRA) module that halves the feature dimensionality before attention computation, and a Feature Preserving Connection (FPC) that restores the original distribution via a lightweight skip‑connection resembling squeeze‑excitation. By embedding VAB within a four‑stage pyramid backbone, the resulting VVT processes full‑resolution feature maps with linear complexity in token count, enabling efficient handling of large inputs.\n\nEmpirical evaluation spans image classification on CIFAR‑100, ImageNet‑1k, and ADE20K semantic segmentation. VVT variants (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large) consistently outperform state‑of‑the‑art transformers (ViT, Swin, PVT, Twins) and competitive CNNs while using roughly 50 % fewer parameters. Notably, VVT‑L achieves 84.1 % top‑1 accuracy on ImageNet‑1k with 61.8 M parameters and exhibits a slower GFLOPs growth rate as input resolution increases. Ablation studies confirm that both the 2D locality bias and the FRA/FPC design contribute to accuracy gains; replacing Vicinity Attention with 1‑D cosine re‑weighting (cosFormer) leads to divergence on large‑scale data, underscoring the necessity of the proposed 2D formulation. Qualitative Grad‑CAM visualizations further demonstrate that VVT concentrates attention on semantically relevant regions, a direct benefit of the locality‑aware weighting.\n\nDespite these strengths, the work exhibits several limitations. First, while FRA reduces computational cost, it introduces an additional hyper‑parameter (reduction ratio) whose optimal setting is empirically determined; inappropriate choices can degrade performance, suggesting sensitivity to architecture tuning. Second, the memory analysis reveals that VVT’s absolute memory footprint remains higher than some recent efficient transformers (e.g., Performer, Linformer) for very high resolutions, indicating that linear complexity alone does not guarantee scalability on memory‑constrained hardware. Third, the experiments focus on standard benchmarks; robustness to distribution shifts, adversarial perturbations, or domain adaptation scenarios is not explored, leaving open questions about the generality of the learned locality bias. Future work could address these issues by extending Vicinity Attention to adaptive, data‑driven distance metrics, integrating dynamic reduction strategies, and evaluating the approach on broader vision modalities and robustness benchmarks.\n",

    "final_summary_judge": "Final Summary: # Integrated Summary of Recent Vision Transformer Advances and First‑Person Vision Survey\n\n## 1. Surface Vision Transformer (SiT)\n- **Motivation & Pipeline**: Dahan *et al.* (2022) cast cortical surface analysis as a sequence‑to‑sequence problem. Genus‑zero cortical meshes are projected onto a regularly tessellated icosphere, partitioned into equal‑area triangular patches, each flattened into a token for a standard ViT encoder. A learnable target token and sinusoidal positional embeddings enable operation on both template‑aligned and native (unregistered) surfaces without explicit rotational equivariance.\n- **Model variants**: DeiT‑Tiny (5.5 M parameters) → **SiT‑tiny**; DeiT‑Small (21.6 M) → **SiT‑small**.\n- **Training strategies**:\n  1. From scratch.\n  2. ImageNet‑pretrained weights via *timm*.\n  3. Self‑supervised **masked‑patch‑prediction (MPP)** where 50 % of patches are corrupted and reconstructed (MSE loss on masked patches only).\n- **Class‑imbalance handling**: Because term neonates outnumber preterm ones, **balanced‑batch sampling** is performed during training to mitigate bias.\n- **Augmentation effects**: Adding **rotation and dropout augmentations** significantly improves **gestational‑age (GA) prediction**, but has negligible impact on **post‑menstrual age (PMA)** prediction.\n- **Results (dHCP neonatal cortical surfaces)**:\n  | Model | Pre‑training | PMA MAE (weeks) – template / native | GA MAE (weeks) – template / native |\n  |---|---|---|---|\n  | SiT‑small | MPP | **0.55 / 0.63** (avg ≈ 0.59) | **1.02 / 1.21** (avg ≈ 1.12) |\n  | SiT‑small | ImageNet | 0.59 / 0.71 | 1.13 / 1.30 |\n  | SiT‑tiny | MPP | 0.58 / 0.64 | 1.03 / 1.31 |\n  | SiT‑tiny | ImageNet | 0.67 / 0.70 | 1.11 / 1.20 |\n  The MoNet baseline reaches **MAE = 0.57 / 0.61 weeks for PMA**, not for GA. SiT matches or surpasses the best surface CNNs (S2CNN, GConvNet, ChebNet) and degrades less on unregistered data, indicating a degree of transformation invariance.\n- **Limitations & Future Work**: Restricted to genus‑zero manifolds, fixed patch size may lose fine detail, vanilla ViT encoder could be replaced by hierarchical or manifold‑aware attention, and pre‑training could be broadened beyond ImageNet and MPP.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Glance‑and‑Gaze Vision Transformer (GG‑Transformer)\n- **Problem**: Vanilla self‑attention scales quadratically with token length, limiting high‑resolution dense tasks.\n- **Architecture**:\n  - **Glance branch**: Input is split into *adaptively‑dilated partitions*; each partition samples tokens globally, yielding linear‑complexity global attention.\n  - **Gaze branch**: After merging partitions, a lightweight **depth‑wise convolution** (3×3 or adaptive kernel) injects local context.\n  - The two streams are merged, preserving spatial resolution.\n- **Integration**: The **GG‑MSA** block replaces standard MSA in Swin‑style and DeiT back‑bones.\n- **Quantitative gains**:\n  - **ImageNet‑1K (224×224)**: GG‑T achieves **82.0 %** top‑1 (+0.8 % over Swin‑T); GG‑S reaches **83.4 %** (+0.2 % over Swin‑S).\n  - **ADE20K semantic segmentation (UperNet)**: GG‑T attains **46.4 %** mIoU, surpassing ResNet‑50, PVT‑Small, and Swin‑T (multi‑scale) by **3.6 %**, **1.6 %**, and **0.6 %**, respectively. GG‑S obtains **48.4 %** mIoU, comparable to Swin‑S.\n  - **COCO detection & instance segmentation (Mask R‑CNN / Cascade Mask R‑CNN)**:\n    * GG‑T: box AP **44.1** (↑0.4) and mask AP **39.9** (↑0.1) over Swin‑T.\n    * GG‑S: box AP **45.7** (↑0.3) and mask AP **41.3** (↑0.1) over Swin‑S.\n- **Ablations**: Removing either Glance or Gaze drops accuracy by 3–4 %; depth‑wise convolution outperforms a self‑attention‑based Gaze while staying within the same FLOP budget.\n- **Limitations**: Data‑efficiency challenges remain, performance may suffer on extreme aspect‑ratio images, and fixed‑size positional encodings can degrade when testing at resolutions far from training.\n\n---\n\n## 3. ViTAEv2 – Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring Inductive Bias\n- **Core Idea**: Explicitly inject **locality** and **scale‑invariance** into ViTs via two elementary cells that can be stacked isotropically or in a multi‑stage fashion.\n- **Cells**:\n  - **Reduction Cell (RC)** – Pyramid Reduction Module with atrous convolutions (dilation sets S₁=[1,2,3,4], S₂=[1,2,3], S₃=[1,2]) and down‑sampling ratios 4×, 2×, 2×.\n  - **Normal Cell (NC)** – Parallel Convolutional Module (three 3×3 convs + BN + SiLU) followed by MHSA and FFN.\n- **Fusion strategy**: **Early fusion** of PCM and MHSA **before** the FFN, combined with **BatchNorm**, yields the best ImageNet‑1K top‑1 (~69.9 %). Late fusion performs worse.\n- **Attention types per stage** (example ViTAEv2‑S): `W, W, F, F` (window attention in first two stages, full attention in last two), reducing memory while keeping accuracy.\n- **Training regimes**:\n  - Standard supervised training on **ImageNet‑1K**.\n  - **MAE self‑supervised pre‑training** (75 % mask) followed by fine‑tuning for the larger variants (ViTAE‑B, ViTAE‑L, ViTAE‑H).\n- **Model sizes**:\n  - **ViTAE‑H** (isotropic) – 644 M parameters.\n  - **ViTAE‑B** (MAE‑pre‑trained) – 89.7 M parameters.\n  - **ViTAE‑L** – 311 M parameters.\n  - **ViTAEv2‑S** (multi‑stage) – 19.2 M parameters; trained on only **5 %** of ImageNet‑1K and still reaches **82.6 %** top‑1.\n- **Downstream performance**:\n  - **COCO detection (Mask RCNN)** – APᵇ 46.3 % (ViTAEv2‑S) vs. ResNet‑50 42.0 %.\n  - **ADE20K segmentation** – 45.0 % mIoU (single‑scale) vs. ResNet‑50 42.1 %.\n  - **Animal pose (AP‑10K)** – AP 0.718, outperforming ResNet‑50 and Swin‑T.\n- **Limitations**: Added architectural complexity, still data‑hungry for the biggest models, focus solely on image‑centric tasks, and limited robustness evaluation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Evo‑ViT – Slow‑Fast Token Evolution\n- **Motivation**: Reduce ViT inference cost without destroying spatial structure; avoid costly pre‑training required by many token‑pruning methods.\n- **Mechanism**:\n  1. **Structure‑preserving token selection** using **class‑token attention** (CLS‑attention) that is further refined by an **evolved global class attention** across layers (Eq. 4).\n  2. Top‑k tokens become **informative (object) tokens** processed by the full ViT pipeline (slow path).\n  3. Remaining tokens are merged into a **single placeholder token**, updated by the same MSA + FFN (fast path); the resulting residual is broadcast back to every placeholder token (Eq. 7).\n- **Training schedule (layer‑to‑stage)**:\n  - Token selection begins at the **5th encoder layer** (DeiT) or **9th layer** (LeViT) and is applied for the first **200 epochs**.\n  - In the final **100 epochs**, selection is retained **only at the beginning of each stage**, while updating continues in every layer.\n- **Auxiliary loss**: An additional **CLS‑token loss** is added to the standard classification loss to stabilise the evolving class‑attention signal.\n- **Results**: On ImageNet‑1K, Evo‑ViT speeds up DeiT‑S by **>60 % throughput** (2 536 → 4 027 images/s) with a mere **0.4 %** top‑1 drop (72.0 % → 71.6 %). Comparable or better accuracy vs. token‑pruning baselines, with larger speed gains.\n- **Limitations**: Evaluation limited to classification; several hyper‑parameters (keeping ratios, evolution weight α) are set empirically.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quadrangle Attention (QA)\n- **Concept**: Replace fixed rectangular windows with **learnable quadrangles** that better align with object shapes.\n- **Quadrangle regression head**: Very shallow – average‑pool → LeakyReLU → 1×1 convolution – predicts a projective transformation matrix for each default square window.\n- **Operations**: Tokens inside the transformed quadrangle are sampled via **bilinear interpolation** and fed to standard Q‑K‑V attention.\n- **Regularisation**: A term **λ** (set to **1** in experiments) penalises quadrangles that fall largely outside the feature map, stabilising training. Extreme λ values cause divergence.\n- **Out‑of‑bounds handling**: Tokens sampled outside the feature map are **zero‑padded**.\n- **Computational cost**: Bilinear sampling adds **<5 %** of total FLOPs; inference slows by **≈13 %** on an A100 due to unoptimised kernels.\n- **Performance** (QFormer family):\n  - **ImageNet‑1K**: QFormerh‑B 84.1 % top‑1 (+0.7 % over Swin‑B); QFormerh‑T 82.5 % (+0.9 %).\n  - **COCO (Mask‑RCNN)**: QFormerh‑T box AP 45.9 (+0.7), mask AP 41.5 (+0.7).\n  - **COCO (Cascade‑RCNN, 3×)**: box AP 49.8 (+0.7), mask AP 43.0 (+0.7).\n  - **ADE20K (UPerNet)**: mIoU 46.9 (+2.4) for QFormerh‑T.\n  - **COCO keypoints**: AP 77.2 (+0.4).\n- **Ablation**: Each elementary transformation (scale‑shift, shear, rotation, projection) contributes positively; the full composition yields the best gains.\n- **Limitations**: Shallow regression head may restrict modeling of extreme perspective deformations; out‑of‑bounds padding can lead to sparse gradients; compatibility with other self‑supervised or multimodal pre‑training remains untested; runtime overhead could be reduced with fused CUDA kernels.\n\n---\n\n## 6. OAMixer – Object‑aware Mixing Layer\n- **Goal**: Inject a sample‑specific **object‑level inductive bias** into any patch‑mixing mechanism (self‑attention, MLP, convolutional mixing).\n- **Mask formulation**: For layer *l*, the similarity mask is\n  \\[ M_{ij}=\\exp\\bigl(-\\kappa^{(l)}\\cdot d(y_i, y_j)\\bigr) \\]\n  where \\(y_i\\) and \\(y_j\\) are object‑level labels (obtained unsupervised or weakly‑supervised), \\(d\\) is a distance function, and \\(\\kappa^{(l)}\\) is a learnable scalar controlling bias strength.\n- **Application**: The mask is **applied element‑wise before** the linear operators of:\n  1. **Self‑attention** – scales the attention matrix prior to softmax, yielding an object‑aware attention \\(\\tilde A\\).\n  2. **Feed‑forward MLP** – modulates the linear projection of token features.\n  3. **Convolutional mixing** – multiplies the linearised Toeplitz kernel (equivalent to a 2‑D convolution) before convolution.\n- **Results**:\n  - **ImageNet‑1K classification**: DeiT‑B top‑1 rises from **78.45 %** to **82.18 %** (+3.73 %).\n  - **Self‑supervised (DINO) linear probe**: DeiT‑T improves from **59.37 %** to **61.16 %** (+1.79 %).\n  - Demonstrated better robustness to background shifts compared with methods that only use spatial bias (ConViT) or token‑level supervision (TokenLabeling).\n- **General applicability**: Works with ViTs, MLP‑Mixers, ConvMixers, requiring only the mask computation per layer.\n\n---\n\n## 7. PatchRot – Self‑Supervised Pre‑text for ViTs\n- **Pre‑text task**: Either the **whole image** or each **individual patch** is rotated by one of four multiples of 90° (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Image rotation is *not* applied when rotating patches (the combination harms downstream performance).\n- **Prediction heads**:\n  - **Class token** predicts the image‑rotation angle.\n  - **Auxiliary MLP heads** attached to each patch token predict the patch‑rotation angle.\n- **Loss**: Sum of cross‑entropy losses for image‑rotation and all patch‑rotations.\n- **Training details**:\n  - **Architecture**: ViT‑Lite (6 encoder blocks, 256‑dim embeddings, 512‑dim FFN, 4 heads, dropout = 0.1).\n  - **Patch size**: P = 4 for CIFAR‑10/100 & FashionMNIST; P = 8 for Tiny‑ImageNet.\n  - **Buffer‑gap cropping**: A random gap of size **B = 14 % of the patch size** (0–2B px) is inserted between patches, reducing effective resolution (e.g., 24×24 for 32×32 images).\n  - **Optimizer & schedule**: Adam, learning rate **5 × 10⁻⁴**, weight decay **3 × 10⁻²**, warm‑up for 10 epochs, then cosine decay.\n  - **Epochs**: **300** epochs for self‑supervised pre‑training, followed by **200** epochs of supervised fine‑tuning on the downstream classification task.\n- **Results**: Outperforms both a fully supervised baseline and RotNet on CIFAR‑10, CIFAR‑100, FashionMNIST, and Tiny‑ImageNet, especially when deeper encoder layers are fine‑tuned.\n- **Limitations**: Tested only on small‑scale datasets and ViT‑Lite; scalability to larger ViTs and ImageNet‑scale tasks remains unverified; only discrete 90° rotations are used, potentially biasing representations; additional MLP heads increase memory during pre‑training.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Vicinity Vision Transformer (VVT)\n- **Key innovation**: **Vicinity Attention**, a linear‑attention mechanism that re‑weights token interactions by **2‑D Manhattan distance**, enforcing spatial locality while retaining global context.\n- **Vicinity Attention Block (VAB)**:\n  - **Feature Reduction Attention (FRA)** halves the feature dimension before the linear‑complexity attention computation.\n  - **Feature Preserving Connection (FPC)** restores the original dimensionality via a lightweight skip‑connection (squeeze‑excitation‑like).\n- **Architecture**: Four‑stage pyramid backbone; linear complexity in token count enables full‑resolution processing.\n- **Performance** (ImageNet‑1K):\n  - **VVT‑L** – **84.1 %** top‑1 with **61.8 M** parameters, achieving comparable or better accuracy than ViT, Swin, PVT while using ~50 % fewer parameters.\n  - FLOPs grow slower with input resolution, making VVT attractive for high‑resolution inputs.\n- **Ablations**: Both the 2‑D locality bias and the FRA/FPC design contribute; replacing Vicinity Attention with 1‑D cosine re‑weighting (cosFormer) causes divergence on large‑scale data.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - **Memory footprint** is still higher than some recent efficient transformers (e.g., Performer, Linformer) for very high resolutions, showing that linear token complexity alone does not guarantee memory scalability.\n  - The **reduction‑ratio hyper‑parameter** is sensitive; improper settings degrade performance, indicating a need for careful tuning.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Survey of First‑Person Vision (FPV) Methods (1997‑2014)\n- **Scope**: Comprehensive review of egocentric/first‑person vision research from 1997 to 2014, covering over **100** papers.\n- **Trend**: Publication count rises sharply after the introduction of commercial smart‑glasses; Figure 1 in the original paper visualises this growth.\n- **Technical landscape**: Early approaches rely on handcrafted features (color, optical flow, spatio‑temporal interest points) combined with conventional classifiers for tasks such as object detection, activity recognition, and human‑machine interaction.\n- **Real‑time emphasis**: Because wearable devices have limited compute and battery, **real‑time processing** is a recurring design constraint.\n- **Challenges**: Severe camera motion, rapid illumination changes, privacy concerns, and battery life limit algorithmic choices.\n- **Patents (2012)**: Google Glass (U.S. Patent D659,741, May 15 2012) and Microsoft Augmented‑Reality Glasses (U.S. Patent Application 20120293548, Nov 22 2012) illustrate the shift toward commercial interest.\n- **Application domains**: Military & security, enterprise & industrial, tourism services, mass surveillance, medicine & healthcare, driving assistance.\n- **Outlook**: Calls for energy‑efficient algorithms, robust multimodal sensor fusion, and standardized, privacy‑aware evaluation protocols.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Consolidated Takeaways\n- Vision Transformers are rapidly evolving to address **computational efficiency**, **inductive bias incorporation**, and **domain‑specific constraints** (e.g., cortical surfaces, egocentric video, high‑resolution imagery).\n- Across the board, **augmentation strategies**, **self‑supervised pre‑training**, and **architectural hybrids** (convolution + attention, linear‑attention with locality) consistently improve data efficiency and robustness.\n- Limitations that remain common include **sensitivity to hyper‑parameters**, **memory scalability at extreme resolutions**, and **restricted evaluation to image‑centric tasks**.\n- Future research directions highlighted repeatedly are **hierarchical or adaptive attention mechanisms**, **broader self‑supervision**, **cross‑modal fusion**, and **privacy‑preserving, real‑time algorithms** for wearable and biomedical applications.\n",
    "SOTA_judge": "Gaps in SOTA: High-Impact Research Opportunities:\n\n- **Unified Transformer Framework for Arbitrary-Genus Surface Analysis**\n  *Research Question*: How can we design a vision‑transformer architecture that operates directly on meshes of any topology (genus > 0) without relying on spherical re‑parameterization?\n  *Justification*: The Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) is limited to genus‑zero meshes and its preprocessing (icosphere projection, interpolation) may distort geometry. No existing work addresses higher‑genus biomedical surfaces (e.g., cardiac chambers, vascular networks) or non‑medical manifolds.\n  *Impact*: A topology‑agnostic transformer would broaden surface‑learning to all anatomical structures, enable cross‑domain studies, and eliminate preprocessing bias, establishing a new standard for geometric deep learning.\n\n- **Self‑Supervised, Geometry‑Preserving Pre‑Training for Surface and Volumetric Transformers**\n  *Research Question*: Can we develop contrastive or masked‑modeling objectives that respect intrinsic surface geometry (e.g., geodesic neighborhoods) and simultaneously learn rotation‑equivariant representations for both surfaces and volumetric data?\n  *Justification*: Across the surveyed papers, pre‑training strategies are simplistic (ImageNet, masked‑patch prediction) and lack spatial bias; SiT’s MPP improves performance but does not enforce equivariance. Moreover, existing SSL methods for ViTs (e.g., MAE, DINO) are not evaluated on surface data.\n  *Impact*: A geometry‑aware SSL regime would reduce dependence on large labeled datasets, improve robustness to registration/rotation, and provide a unified pre‑training recipe for surface, 2‑D, and 3‑D domains.\n\n- **Adaptive, Multi‑Scale Attention Modules with Theoretical Guarantees**\n  *Research Question*: What is the optimal formulation of attention that combines locality, scale‑invariance, and adaptive shape (e.g., quadrangles, dilated windows) while offering provable bounds on computational complexity and expressivity?\n  *Justification*: Multiple works (ViTAEv2, Quadrangle Attention, Glance‑and‑Gaze, Vicinity) propose ad‑hoc attention variants but lack unified theory; many add modest gains at the cost of extra hyper‑parameters and implementation complexity. Theoretical analysis is shallow, and marginal gains are sometimes outweighed by overhead.\n  *Impact*: A principled, mathematically‑grounded attention design would streamline architecture search, enable predictable scaling to ultra‑high‑resolution inputs, and facilitate deployment on resource‑constrained devices.\n\n- **Dynamic Token Evolution Beyond Classification Tokens for Diverse Downstream Tasks**\n  *Research Question*: How can we generalize slow‑fast token evolution mechanisms to tasks that lack a dedicated class token (e.g., detection, segmentation, video) and to multimodal inputs (e.g., audio‑visual) while preserving efficiency?\n  *Justification*: Evo‑ViT’s token selection hinges on the CLS token and is only validated on ImageNet classification. No study explores its effect on dense prediction or video, nor on models without CLS tokens. The overhead and hyper‑parameter tuning remain opaque.\n  *Impact*: Extending dynamic token pruning to a broader set of tasks would dramatically cut inference costs for real‑time applications (autonomous driving, AR/VR) and provide a universal efficiency layer for transformer backbones.\n\n- **Robust, Scalable Evaluation Benchmarks for Surface‑Based Transformers**\n  *Research Question*: Can we construct a comprehensive benchmark suite that includes multiple genus‑zero and higher‑genus biomedical surfaces, varied registration perturbations, and cross‑modal tasks (e.g., surface‑to‑image translation), together with statistical significance testing?\n  *Justification*: Current evaluations are confined to neonatal cortical meshes, lack statistical testing, and ignore higher‑genus manifolds. Moreover, many papers omit comparisons to the latest baselines and do not report memory/compute metrics.\n  *Impact*: A standardized, statistically‑rigorous benchmark would accelerate reproducibility, expose true performance gaps, and drive the community toward more generalizable and efficient surface transformer models."
