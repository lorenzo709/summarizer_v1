            "summary": "The paper introduces the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT), a novel framework that extends Vision Transformers (ViTs) to non‑Euclidean surface data by reformulating surface learning as a sequence‑to‑sequence problem. The core contribution lies in a surface‑patching mechanism that projects arbitrary genus‑zero meshes onto a regularly tessellated icosphere, partitions the sphere into equal‑area triangular patches, and flattens each patch into a token for the transformer encoder. This design circumvents the limited receptive field and rotational equivariance constraints inherent to existing geometric deep‑learning (gDL) methods such as S2CNN, ChebNet, GConvNet, MoNet and spherical U‑Nets, while preserving the global‑context modelling capabilities of self‑attention.\n\nMethodologically, SiT adopts a vanilla ViT encoder (12 layers) with multi‑head self‑attention and feed‑forward networks, instantiated in two scales (SiT‑tiny and SiT‑small) mirroring DeiT configurations. Input surface features (sulcal depth, curvature, cortical thickness, T1w/T2w ratio) are first resampled onto a 32 k‑vertex template, projected onto a sixth‑order icosphere (≈41 k vertices), and then aggregated into 320 patches of 153 vertices each. Positional embeddings and an additional token encoding scan age are concatenated before transformer processing. The authors explore three training regimes—training from scratch, ImageNet‑pre‑training, and self‑supervised masked‑patch‑prediction (MPP) pre‑training—combined with data augmentation (random rotations) and dropout. Experiments on the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset evaluate two neonatal phenotypes: post‑menstrual age at scan (PMA) and gestational age at birth (GA), both in template‑aligned and native (unregistered) spaces.\n\nEmpirically, SiT‑small pre‑trained with MPP attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) across tasks (0.85 weeks for GA, 1.12 weeks for PMA), outperforming the best gDL baseline (MoNet, MAE ≈ 1.05 weeks) and showing reduced performance degradation on unregistered data. Pre‑training on ImageNet yields modest gains, while MPP self‑supervision provides the most consistent improvements, particularly when coupled with rotational augmentation. The authors also demonstrate a de‑confounding strategy that injects scan age as an extra embedding, further enhancing GA prediction.\n\nDespite these advances, the study exhibits several limitations. First, the reliance on spherical projection restricts applicability to genus‑zero surfaces; extending SiT to higher‑genus meshes would require non‑trivial topological handling. Second, the patching scheme enforces a fixed spatial granularity, potentially discarding fine‑scale geometric details critical for certain biomedical tasks. Third, the transformer architecture lacks explicit inductive biases such as rotational equivariance, which may limit robustness to arbitrary orientations despite augmentation. Fourth, the experimental validation is confined to a single neonatal MRI cohort, raising concerns about generalisability to adult brains or other modalities. Finally, the computational overhead of transformer training on high‑resolution meshes remains substantial, and the impact of larger pre‑training corpora or multi‑task learning is not explored. Future work should address these constraints by incorporating hierarchical or adaptive patching, designing equivariant attention mechanisms, and evaluating SiT on diverse surface datasets.\n",

            "paper_id": "Glance-and-Gaze Vision Transformer",
            "summary": "The Glance-and-Gaze Vision Transformer (GG‑Transformer) addresses the quadratic complexity of standard self‑attention, which hampers the application of vision Transformers to high‑resolution, dense‑prediction tasks. Building on the observation that human perception alternates between a rapid global \"glance\" and a focused local \"gaze\", the authors propose a dual‑branch Transformer block. The Glance branch performs self‑attention on adaptively‑dilated partitions of the feature map; tokens belonging to a partition are sampled with a dilation rate proportional to the spatial dimensions, thus preserving a global receptive field while reducing the attention matrix to linear size. The Gaze branch supplements the Glance output with a lightweight depth‑wise convolution that captures fine‑grained local interactions across partition boundaries. Both branches operate in parallel and are merged by an inverse dilated‑splitting operation, yielding a feature map of identical spatial layout to the input. The resulting GG‑MSA module has a computational cost of \\(4NC^2+2M^2NC+k^2NC\\) (with \\(M\\) and \\(k\\) constant), offering linear scaling with respect to the token count while retaining global context.\n\nEmpirically, GG‑Transformer is instantiated in two configurations (GG‑T and GG‑S) that match the parameter and FLOP budgets of Swin‑T and Swin‑S respectively. Trained on ImageNet‑1K under the same recipe as Swin, GG‑T achieves 82.0% top‑1 accuracy (+0.8% over Swin‑T) and GG‑S reaches 83.4% (+0.2%). On ADE20K semantic segmentation (UperNet), GG‑T attains 46.4% mIoU with single‑scale testing, surpassing ResNet‑50, PVT‑Small and Swin‑T (multi‑scale) by 3.6–0.6%. In COCO object detection (Mask‑RCNN) and instance segmentation (Cascaded Mask‑RCNN), GG‑T improves box AP from 43.7% (Swin‑T) to 44.1% and mask AP from 39.8% to 39.9%, while GG‑S yields comparable gains over Swin‑S. Ablation studies confirm that both branches are necessary: Glance‑only or Gaze‑only configurations degrade performance relative to the baseline, whereas their combination recovers and exceeds it. Replacing the Gaze convolution with a local‑window attention incurs a 1.21% drop, suggesting depth‑wise convolutions remain more effective for short‑range modeling.\n\nDespite these advantages, the paper acknowledges several limitations. First, GG‑Transformer inherits the data‑efficiency concerns of vision Transformers; stronger variants tend to over‑fit on modest‑size datasets such as ADE20K, necessitating large‑scale pre‑training or aggressive regularization. Second, the adaptive dilated splitting relies on a fixed partition size (\\(M\\)) and a deterministic dilation schedule, which may be sub‑optimal for images whose aspect ratios differ markedly from the training distribution, potentially causing degraded attention quality when test‑time resolutions diverge. Third, the depth‑wise convolution, while inexpensive, introduces an inductive bias toward isotropic locality that may not capture anisotropic structures (e.g., elongated objects) as effectively as more expressive local attention mechanisms. Finally, the authors briefly mention broader societal implications of more capable AI systems but do not discuss bias in the training data or the environmental cost of pre‑training large Transformers. Future work could explore dynamic partitioning strategies, hybrid Gaze modules that combine convolution with adaptive local attention, and systematic robustness analyses across varying image scales and domains.",

            "paper_id": "ViTAEv2_ Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring Inductive Bias for Image Recognition and Beyond",
            "summary": "Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capability in modelling long‑range dependencies via self‑attention, yet they fundamentally treat images as 1‑D token sequences and lack intrinsic inductive biases (IBs) such as locality and scale‑invariance that are naturally embedded in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  Zhang et al. (2022) address this gap by explicitly incorporating two IBs—locality and multi‑scale context—into a novel transformer architecture named ViTAE (Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring Inductive bias) and its multi‑stage extension ViTAEv2.  The core contribution lies in the design of two complementary cell types: a Reduction Cell (RC) that embeds multi‑scale information through a pyramid reduction module (PRM) employing atrous convolutions with varied dilation rates, and a Normal Cell (NC) that fuses a parallel convolutional module (PCM) with standard multi‑head self‑attention (MHSA).  By stacking RCs and NCs either isotropically or across four stages, the authors construct a family of models ranging from 4.8 M to 644 M parameters.  Training is performed with supervised ImageNet‑1K as well as self‑supervised MAE pre‑training, and extensive experiments on ImageNet, ImageNet‑Real, COCO, ADE20K, and AP10K show that ViTAE‑H (644 M) achieves 88.5 % Top‑1 accuracy on ImageNet‑val and 91.2 % on ImageNet‑Real without external data, surpassing Swin‑Transformer and other state‑of‑the‑art ViTs of comparable size.  Moreover, ViTAEv2‑B (89.7 M) yields 84.6 % Top‑1 with 10 % of the training data, evidencing superior data‑efficiency.  Downstream evaluations reveal consistent gains: object detection (Mask‑RCNN, Cascade‑RCNN) improves AP by up to 2.6 points over Swin‑T; semantic segmentation (ADE20K) gains 3–4 % mIoU; and animal pose estimation (AP‑10K) increases AP by 3 % compared with ResNet‑50 and Swin‑T backbones.  Ablation studies confirm that early fusion of PCM and MHSA, batch‑norm within PCM, and modest dilation rates in PRM are critical for performance, while larger dilations or late fusion degrade accuracy.\n\nDespite these strengths, the work exhibits several limitations.  First, the introduced convolutions increase memory footprint and computational cost, particularly at high resolutions; although the authors mitigate this with Performer‑based attention in early stages, the trade‑off remains unfavorable for ultra‑large inputs.  Second, the reliance on handcrafted dilation schedules and fixed kernel sizes introduces architectural rigidity, limiting adaptability to novel domains where optimal receptive‑field configurations may differ.  Third, the evaluation focuses primarily on standard benchmarks; robustness to distribution shift, adversarial attacks, or real‑world low‑light conditions is only briefly addressed, leaving open questions about generalisation beyond curated datasets.  Fourth, the self‑supervised pre‑training follows MAE with a high masking ratio, which may obscure the benefits of the IBs when a large proportion of tokens are removed, suggesting a potential bias toward datasets with rich textures.  Finally, while ViTAEv2 demonstrates data‑efficiency, training still requires lengthy schedules (up to 1,600 epochs for large models), indicating that the inductive bias does not fully alleviate the data‑hungry nature of transformer models.\n\nIn summary, ViTAE/ViTAEv2 present a compelling integration of CNN‑style inductive biases into transformer backbones, achieving state‑of‑the‑art accuracy and efficiency across classification and dense prediction tasks.  Future work could explore dynamic, learnable dilation strategies, more lightweight convolutional branches, and broader robustness assessments to fully realize the promise of bias‑augmented vision transformers.\n",

            "paper_id": "Evo-ViT_ Slow-Fast Token Evolution for Dynamic Vision Transformer",
            "summary": "Evo-ViT: Slow‑Fast Token Evolution for Dynamic Vision Transformer addresses the persistent computational burden of Vision Transformers (ViTs), whose quadratic complexity with respect to token count limits their practical deployment. The authors’ primary contribution is a self‑motivated \"slow‑fast\" token evolution framework that simultaneously preserves the spatial structure of the input and enables dynamic token reduction from the outset of training. Unlike prior token‑pruning pipelines, which either discard tokens (leading to incomplete spatial information) or require costly pre‑training and static pruning masks, Evo‑ViT leverages the native class token attention to perform instance‑wise token selection. Informative tokens are identified via an evolved global class attention that aggregates class attention across layers, while the remaining placeholder tokens are retained and updated via a lightweight fast‑path. The informative tokens undergo a \"slow\" update through the full multi‑head self‑attention (MSA) and feed‑forward network (FFN), whereas placeholder tokens are summarised into a representative token and subsequently propagated to all placeholders via a residual‑based fast update. This bifurcated updating preserves full information flow, mitigates the loss of background context, and maintains compatibility with both flat‑structure ViTs (e.g., DeiT) and deep‑narrow architectures (e.g., LeViT).\n\nMethodologically, Evo‑ViT introduces three key components: (1) a structure‑preserving token selection module that uses the global class attention α·A_{k-1}^{cls,g}+(1-α)·A_k^{cls} to stabilize token importance across layers; (2) a slow‑fast token updating mechanism that computes slow updates for informative tokens via standard MSA/FFN and fast updates for placeholders using the residuals of a representative token; and (3) a layer‑to‑stage training schedule that progressively stabilises token selection, reducing the need for explicit distillation losses. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet‑1K demonstrate that Evo‑ViT accelerates DeiT‑S by over 60% throughput with a mere 0.4% top‑1 accuracy drop, and yields comparable gains on LeViT despite its inherently reduced token redundancy. Ablation studies confirm the additive benefit of each component, and visualisations illustrate that token selection consistently focuses on foreground objects while preserving background tokens for contextual reasoning.\n\nDespite its promising results, Evo‑ViT exhibits several limitations. First, the reliance on class token attention assumes that the CLS token reliably reflects token importance throughout training; this may not hold for tasks lacking a clear global class token (e.g., dense prediction) or for datasets with highly ambiguous foreground/background delineations. Second, the fast‑update path aggregates placeholder tokens into a single representative token, potentially oversimplifying diverse background cues and limiting expressiveness in scenes with multiple informative background regions. Third, the layer‑to‑stage schedule, while effective for ImageNet classification, introduces additional hyper‑parameters (e.g., stage boundaries, α) whose optimal settings may vary across architectures and resolutions, raising concerns about reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, the method has been evaluated only on classification; extending to detection or segmentation may require redesigning the token‑selection criteria. Finally, the computational overhead of maintaining both slow and fast pathways, albeit modest, could diminish gains on hardware with limited parallelism. Future work should explore adaptive class‑attention mechanisms for non‑classification tasks, richer placeholder representations (e.g., multi‑prototype summarisation), and automated schedule optimisation to broaden the applicability of slow‑fast token evolution across diverse vision domains.\n",

            "paper_id": "Vision Transformer with Quadrangle Attention",
            "summary": "In recent vision transformer (ViT) research, window‑based self‑attention has been adopted to reduce the quadratic complexity of global attention while preserving strong performance on a variety of visual tasks.  Nevertheless, existing designs rely on hand‑crafted, fixed‑size rectangular windows that are agnostic to the geometry of objects in the scene, thereby limiting the ability of the model to capture long‑range dependencies for objects of diverse scales, shapes, and orientations.  To address this limitation, Zhang *et al.* propose a novel **Quadrangle Attention (QA)** mechanism and integrate it into both plain and hierarchical ViTs, resulting in a new family of architectures called **QFormer**.\n\n**Methodology.**  QA extends the conventional window partitioning by learning, for each head, a projective transformation that maps a default square window to an arbitrary quadrangle.  A lightweight quadrangle‑regression module predicts nine parameters (scale, shear, rotation, translation, and projection) via average‑pooling, LeakyReLU, and a 1\\times1 convolution applied to the window’s features.  The transformation is factorised into elementary operations (scaling, shearing, rotation, translation, projection) to improve training stability.  Tokens within the resulting quadrangle are sampled using bilinear interpolation; tokens falling outside the feature map are padded with zeros.  A regularization term penalises quadrangles that extend beyond the valid region, encouraging reasonable coverage.  The attention computation itself remains unchanged (query‑key‑value dot‑product followed by softmax), thus incurring only a negligible overhead (≈5% extra FLOPs) compared with standard window attention.\n\n**Key Results.**  Extensive experiments on ImageNet‑1K, MS‑COCO, ADE20K, and COCO‑keypoint benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains across classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation.  For example, QFormer‑T achieves 83.2% top‑1 accuracy on ImageNet‑1K at 384×384 resolution, surpassing Swin‑T by 0.9% while using comparable parameters and memory.  In detection, QFormerp‑B improves Mask‑RCNN mAP\\_bb from 51.6 to 52.3 and mAP\\_mk from 45.9 to 46.6.  Semantic segmentation sees up to a 2.4 mIoU improvement over Swin‑T, and pose estimation benefits from a 1.5 AP gain.  Ablation studies confirm that each basic transformation contributes incrementally, and that the composed transformation outperforms a direct prediction of the full projective matrix.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions.**  Despite its flexibility, QA inherits several constraints.  First, the quadrangle regression operates independently per head and per window, which may lead to inconsistent shapes across heads and hinder joint optimization; a unified multi‑head formulation could improve coherence.  Second, the sampling strategy discards tokens outside the feature map, potentially wasting informative context when quadrangles straddle image borders; adaptive padding or border‑aware extensions might alleviate this.  Third, the current regularization relies on a hand‑tuned hyper‑parameter λ, and the authors report sensitivity to its value, indicating a need for more principled constraints (e.g., learned priors on shape variability).  Fourth, QA is evaluated only with supervised pre‑training; its impact on self‑supervised or multimodal pre‑training remains unexplored.  Finally, the computational overhead, while modest, stems from bilinear sampling that is not fully optimized in existing deep‑learning libraries, limiting inference speed on hardware where matrix multiplication is highly accelerated.  Future work could therefore focus on (i) designing head‑sharing transformation predictors, (ii) integrating border‑aware or content‑aware sampling, (iii) learning regularization directly from data, (iv) extending QA to self‑supervised pipelines, and (v) implementing hardware‑friendly sampling kernels to close the speed gap with conventional window attention.\n",

            "paper_id": "OAMixer_ Object-aware Mixing Layer for Vision Transformers",
            "summary": "OAMixer: Object‑aware Mixing Layer for Vision Transformers introduces a universal framework that endows patch‑based vision models with an object‑centric inductive bias. The authors observe that existing patch‑mixing mechanisms—self‑attention, feed‑forward MLPs, and convolutional mixers—treat all patches uniformly, thereby ignoring the intrinsic scene structure defined by objects. OAMixer addresses this gap by computing a data‑specific re‑weighting mask from patch‑wise object labels, which are obtained in an unsupervised or weakly‑supervised fashion, thus avoiding additional human annotation costs. The mask modulates the interaction matrix of any patch‑mixing layer via a learnable scale parameter, strengthening intra‑object communications while attenuating inter‑object and background connections. This simple yet principled alteration can be applied to any transformer‑style architecture, including ViTs, MLP‑Mixers, and ConvMixers, without redesigning the underlying network.\n\nMethodologically, the approach proceeds in two stages. First, object labels y∈ℝ^{N×K} (with K object classes) are assigned to each of the N patches; a similarity function d(·,·) computes pairwise distances between label vectors, and a mask M_{ij}=exp(‑κ_l·d(y_i,y_j)) is formed, where κ_l≥0 is a layer‑wise learnable scalar initialized to zero. Second, the original mixing operator L_mix (self‑attention, linear MLP, or convolution) is element‑wise multiplied by M, and the result is renormalized to preserve the stochastic nature of attention matrices. The authors instantiate OAMixer for three representative mixers: (i) self‑attention, where M rescales the attention matrix before softmax; (ii) feed‑forward layers, where M is applied to the linear projection; and (iii) depth‑wise convolution, where M modifies the Toeplitz representation of the kernel. Experiments on ImageNet‑1K demonstrate consistent gains across backbones: DeiT‑B improves from 78.45% to 82.18% top‑1 accuracy (+3.73%), and linear probing on DINO‑pretrained DeiT‑T rises from 59.37% to 61.16% (+1.79%). Moreover, OAMixer enhances background robustness, outperforms spatial‑bias methods such as ConViT and TokenLabeling, and yields benefits on downstream tasks including self‑supervised learning and multi‑object recognition. Ablation studies reveal that lower layers tend to learn larger κ values (focusing on intra‑object relations), while higher layers adopt smaller κ, mirroring the hierarchical feature integration of CNNs.\n\nDespite its promise, OAMixer exhibits several limitations. The reliance on patch‑level object labels, even when sourced from unsupervised saliency detectors, introduces a dependency on the quality of external label generators; noisy or biased labels can propagate errors into the mask and degrade performance. The current formulation assumes a single dominant object per patch, which may be insufficient for highly overlapping or transparent objects, limiting applicability to complex scenes. Moreover, the scalar κ_l controls mask intensity uniformly across all channel dimensions, potentially restricting finer‑grained modulation of feature interactions. Computationally, the pairwise similarity computation scales quadratically with the number of patches, posing memory challenges for high‑resolution inputs. Finally, the paper evaluates primarily on image classification; broader validation on detection, segmentation, or video domains is absent, leaving open questions about the generality of object‑aware mixing beyond static images. Future work could explore adaptive, multi‑label masks, efficient approximations of the similarity matrix, and integration with task‑specific heads to fully leverage object‑aware inductive bias across vision tasks.\n",
            "pros_cons": "- **Generic applicability**: OAMixer is designed as a plug‑in that can be attached to any patch‑based model (ViT, MLP‑Mixer, ConvMixer) regardless of the specific mixing operation (self‑attention, feed‑forward, convolution), making the contribution broadly useful.\n- **Object‑aware inductive bias without extra manual labeling**: The method leverages object labels obtained from unsupervised or weakly‑supervised detectors, avoiding costly human annotation while still injecting semantic structure into the model.\n- **Simple and lightweight integration**: The core operation is a re‑weighting mask multiplied element‑wise with the existing mixing matrix, plus a learnable scalar per layer. This incurs minimal architectural changes and can be implemented with a few lines of code.\n- **Consistent empirical gains across tasks**: Experiments report improvements in (i) large‑scale ImageNet classification (+3.73% top‑1 for DeiT‑B), (ii) self‑supervised linear probing (+1.79% on ImageNet), (iii) background robustness and multi‑object recognition, demonstrating the method’s versatility.\n- **Complementarity with existing bias‑injection methods**: OAMixer can be combined with spatial‑bias techniques such as ConViT or CoAtNet, yielding additive performance boosts, which indicates the orthogonal nature of object‑aware and spatial inductive biases.\n- **Clear motivation and theoretical framing**: The paper formalises the mixing layer as a linear operator and shows how the mask modifies the interaction matrix, providing an interpretable view of how intra‑object and inter‑object relations are emphasized.\n- **Extensive ablation on mask scale and layer depth**: Analysis of the learned mask‑scale parameter κ(l) reveals sensible behavior (higher values in lower layers, lower values in higher layers), supporting the claim that OAMixer first focuses on intra‑object relations then expands to inter‑object context.\n\n- **Dependence on the quality of pseudo object labels**: The approach assumes that unsupervised/weakly‑supervised detectors produce sufficiently accurate patch‑level object tags. In domains where such detectors fail, the re‑weighting mask may be noisy and could degrade performance.\n- **Additional computational and memory overhead**: Computing an N×N similarity mask for each image (especially for high‑resolution inputs) adds O(N²) cost and memory, which may limit scalability to very large token counts.\n- **Limited evaluation on diverse data regimes**: The paper focuses mainly on ImageNet‑scale image classification and a few downstream tasks. It provides little evidence on low‑resource settings, domain shift scenarios, or non‑image modalities (e.g., video, multimodal data).\n- **Hyper‑parameter sensitivity not fully explored**: The choice of distance function d(·,·), the initialization of κ(l), and the temperature‑like scaling factor are introduced but not thoroughly examined for robustness across architectures.\n- **Potential redundancy with existing spatial bias methods**: While the authors claim orthogonality, the gains over strong spatial‑bias baselines (e.g., ConViT) are modest, raising questions about whether the object‑aware mask offers substantial new information beyond spatial proximity.\n- **Lack of qualitative analysis of failure cases**: The paper shows visualizations of the mask but does not discuss scenarios where OAMixer harms performance, which is important for understanding its limits.\n- **Scalability to video or sequential data is unaddressed**: Although the authors mention video as a future direction, the current formulation does not consider temporal consistency of object masks, limiting immediate applicability to video Transformers.\n- **Complexity of integrating with pre‑trained models**: When applying OAMixer to already pre‑trained checkpoints, fine‑tuning may be required to adapt the mask parameters, adding an extra training step that could be prohibitive in practice.\n"

            "paper_id": "PatchRot_ A Self-Supervised Technique for Training Vision Transformers",
            "summary": "The paper introduces PatchRot, a self‑supervised pre‑training scheme explicitly designed for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Recognizing that existing self‑supervised tasks such as RotNet and Jigsaw were conceived for convolutional networks and that ViTs process images as sequences of patches, the authors propose to predict rotation angles at two hierarchical levels: the whole image and each individual patch. By leveraging the class token for global rotation prediction and attaching auxiliary multilayer‑perceptron (MLP) heads to the token embeddings of every patch, PatchRot forces the backbone to encode both global semantics and fine‑grained local structure, thereby addressing the data‑hungry nature of ViTs.\n\nMethodologically, the authors formalize a rotation operator \\(R(\\cdot;\\iota)\\) with \\(\\iota \\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\) corresponding to multiples of 90°. For each training sample they either rotate the entire image or rotate each patch independently, sampling patch rotations uniformly. The ViT processes the resulting token sequence, and the class token output is fed to an MLP \\(M_0\\) that predicts the image‑level angle, while each patch token passes through a dedicated MLP \\(M_i\\) to predict its local rotation. The overall loss is the sum of cross‑entropy terms over image and patch predictions (Eq. 1). To avoid trivial cues from edge continuity, a buffer gap \\(B\\) is introduced: patches are extracted from a larger region and then cropped, creating random gaps between patches. Training is performed on reduced‑resolution inputs (e.g., 24×24 for CIFAR‑10) with a standard Adam optimizer, cosine‑annealed learning rate, and effective batch size multiplied by five due to the multiple rotated variants per image.\n\nEmpirical evaluation on CIFAR‑10/100, FashionMNIST and Tiny‑ImageNet using a ViT‑Lite architecture demonstrates that PatchRot consistently outperforms both fully supervised training and RotNet. In particular, an ablation on CIFAR‑10 shows a top‑1 accuracy increase from 91.8 % (supervised) to 92.6 % when the full PatchRot pipeline is employed, and the method yields superior fine‑tuning performance across all encoder layers. Visualizations of attention maps suggest that the model learns more discriminative spatial patterns after PatchRot pre‑training.\n\nDespite these gains, the study exhibits several limitations. First, experiments are confined to small‑scale datasets and a down‑scaled ViT, leaving open the question of scalability to large‑resolution benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet‑1k) and deeper transformer variants. Second, the reliance on a fixed set of four rotation angles may restrict the richness of the supervisory signal; more diverse geometric transformations could further enhance representation learning. Third, the buffer‑gap strategy reduces the effective image area and may introduce distribution shift when transferring to full‑resolution downstream tasks, a bias not quantified in the paper. Finally, the additional patch‑wise MLP heads increase memory consumption during pre‑training, which could be prohibitive for high‑resolution inputs.\n\nFuture work should explore (i) extending PatchRot to multi‑angle or continuous rotation spaces, (ii) integrating it with other self‑supervised objectives (e.g., contrastive learning) to capture complementary invariances, (iii) evaluating on large‑scale vision benchmarks and transformer backbones, and (iv) devising more efficient implementations that mitigate the overhead of per‑patch heads while preserving the dual‑level supervision.\n",

            "paper_id": "Vicinity Vision Transformer",
            "summary": "Recent advances in vision transformers have been hampered by the quadratic complexity of softmax‑based self‑attention, which limits their applicability to high‑resolution imagery. Sun et al. (2015) address this bottleneck by introducing Vicinity Vision Transformer (VVT), a linear‑complexity backbone that explicitly incorporates a 2‑D locality bias into the attention mechanism. The core contribution is Vicinity Attention, a linear attention formulation that re‑weights pairwise interactions using a cosine‑modulated Manhattan distance between patches. By decomposing the distance term into row‑ and column‑wise components, the authors retain linear time and memory costs with respect to the number of tokens while encouraging stronger connections among spatially proximate patches. To mitigate the residual quadratic dependence on feature dimension, they propose the Vicinity Attention Block, which consists of Feature Reduction Attention (FRA) that halves the channel dimension before attention, and a Feature Preserving Connection (FPC) that restores the original distribution via a lightweight skip path. This block reduces the overall theoretical complexity to \\(O(N(2d)^2 + 2d^2)\\), where \\(N\\) is the token count and \\(d\\) the embedding size.\n\nVVT is instantiated as a four‑stage pyramid network, each stage comprising a patch‑embedding layer followed by multiple Vicinity Transformer blocks. Variants (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large) span 12–62 M parameters and are evaluated on CIFAR‑100, ImageNet‑1k, and ADE20K. Across these benchmarks VVT consistently outperforms prior transformer‑based and convolutional backbones: on ImageNet‑1k VVT‑L achieves 84.1 % top‑1 accuracy with 61.8 M parameters, a 0.3 % gain over the best existing linear transformer while using ~50 % fewer parameters. On ADE20K semantic segmentation, VVT‑L attains 48.8 % mIoU, surpassing Swin‑B and Twins‑L with comparable FLOPs. Ablation studies demonstrate that (i) 2‑D locality yields a 6 % absolute improvement over 1‑D locality or no locality, (ii) FRA alone reduces GFLOPs by ~30 % with negligible accuracy loss, and (iii) FPC recovers a 0.5 % accuracy boost after dimensionality reduction. The authors also report favorable memory growth rates, noting that VVT’s linear attention scales more gracefully than Performer, Linformer, or Quadtree‑based methods.\n\nDespite these strengths, several limitations merit discussion. First, the locality bias is encoded via a handcrafted Manhattan distance and cosine weighting, which may not optimally capture anisotropic visual relationships or adapt to irregular object shapes; learning a data‑driven positional kernel could improve flexibility. Second, while FRA curtails the quadratic term in feature dimension, the residual \\(O(d^2)\\) component can still dominate for very deep models or when scaling to extremely high‑resolution inputs, as evidenced by out‑of‑memory failures at 512×512 resolution for some baselines. Third, the pyramid design relies on fixed patch sizes and reduction ratios, potentially limiting the method’s applicability to tasks requiring fine‑grained spatial precision (e.g., dense pose estimation). Fourth, the experimental suite focuses primarily on classification and semantic segmentation; robustness to domain shift, occlusion, or adversarial perturbations remains unexplored. Finally, the codebase is publicly released but the paper does not provide a thorough analysis of training stability or hyper‑parameter sensitivity, leaving open the risk of brittle convergence in different hardware settings. Future work could address these issues by learning adaptive locality functions, integrating hierarchical attention across scales, and extending evaluation to broader vision tasks and robustness benchmarks.\n",

Its primary goal is to chart the chronological development of FPV methodologies, to catalogue the most frequently employed visual features and algorithmic strategies, and to contextualise these advances within the rapid emergence of wearable recording devices such as action cameras and smart‑glasses. The authors contribute a comprehensive taxonomy that organises the literature according to (i) hardware categories (head‑mounted cameras, smart‑glasses, multimodal wearables), (ii) feature families (color, texture, motion, shape, hand‑centric cues), and (iii) application domains (object detection, activity recognition, user‑machine interaction). In addition, the survey compiles publicly available FPV datasets, summarises their acquisition conditions, and highlights the scarcity of standardized benchmarks.\n\nMethodologically, the authors conduct an exhaustive literature search across major computer‑vision venues, extracting 150+ papers that explicitly address FPV video processing. Publication trends are visualised (Fig. 1) to demonstrate a steep increase in output following the introduction of commercial smart‑glasses prototypes in the early 2010s. The survey tabulates hardware specifications (sensor types, field‑of‑view, battery constraints) and aligns them with algorithmic choices, revealing a shift from handcrafted feature pipelines toward hybrid systems that combine motion‑based descriptors (e.g., optical flow) with hand‑detection heuristics for activity inference. Key empirical observations include the dominance of motion cues for egocentric activity segmentation, the growing relevance of hand‑region analysis for object manipulation tasks, and the nascent attempts at real‑time processing enabled by the computational capabilities of modern wearables.\n\nDespite its breadth, the study exhibits several limitations. First, the temporal scope ends in 2014, thereby excluding the recent surge of deep‑learning approaches that have since reshaped FPV research; this restricts the survey's relevance to contemporary method development. Second, the reliance on published academic papers introduces a selection bias, potentially overlooking industrial contributions and proprietary datasets that could alter the perceived feature‑method landscape. Third, the hardware overview, while detailed for the surveyed period, rapidly becomes outdated given the accelerated evolution of sensor miniaturisation, power‑efficient processors, and augmented‑reality displays. Fourth, performance comparisons across studies are largely qualitative, as the authors note the absence of unified evaluation protocols, which hampers objective assessment of methodological progress.\n\nThe authors conclude by outlining future research directions: the establishment of common benchmark suites and evaluation metrics; integration of deep neural architectures for end‑to‑end egocentric perception; systematic treatment of privacy, battery life, and user comfort constraints; and the exploitation of multimodal sensor fusion (e.g., inertial, audio, eye‑tracking) to enrich context understanding.

Positional embeddings are added and an **extra scan‑age token** encodes the subject’s age.\n- **Training regimes:** Three regimes were explored – (1) training from scratch, (2) ImageNet‑pre‑training, and (3) self‑supervised **masked‑patch‑prediction (MPP)** pre‑training. **MPP yielded the best performance**.\n- **Results:** On the dHCP neonatal dataset, **SiT‑small with MPP** achieved MAE = 0.85 weeks for gestational age (GA) and MAE = 1.12 weeks for post‑menstrual age (PMA), outperforming the strongest geometric‑DL baseline (MoNet, MAE ≈ 1.05 weeks) and showing reduced degradation on unregistered data. Adding the scan‑age token further improved GA prediction.\n\n### Glance‑and‑Gaze Transformer (GG‑Transformer)\n- **Dual‑branch block:** *Glance* branch performs self‑attention on adaptively dilated partitions (linear‑size attention), while *Gaze* branch adds a lightweight depth‑wise convolution to capture fine‑grained interactions across partition boundaries.

    "SOTA": "Gaps in SOTA: High-Impact Research Opportunities\n- **Topology‑agnostic Surface Transformers**: *Research Question*: How can we design vision‑transformer architectures that operate directly on arbitrary‑genus meshes without requiring spherical projection? *Justification*: The Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) is limited to genus‑zero surfaces, and spherical mapping introduces geometric distortion, restricting applicability to cortical data and excluding many biomedical meshes (e.g., cardiac, protein structures). A topology‑agnostic approach (e.g., intrinsic graph‑based attention, spectral positional encodings) would close this methodological gap and broaden the impact of transformer models across 3‑D biomedical domains.\n- **Multi‑scale Hierarchical Patching for Non‑Euclidean and Euclidean Vision Transformers**: *Research Question*: Can a unified multi‑resolution patching scheme—combining adaptive quadrangle, spherical, and regular tessellations—be integrated with transformer attention to capture fine‑to‑coarse patterns on surfaces and images? *Justification*: Multiple papers (SiT, Quadrangle Attention, Glance‑and‑Gaze) evaluate only a single patch scale or fixed regular tessellation, missing hierarchical context that is crucial for highly folded cortical regions and objects of varying size. Introducing learnable, scale‑varying patches would address the noted lack of multi‑scale modeling and improve both accuracy and computational efficiency.\n- **Domain‑Specific Self‑Supervised Pre‑training for Geometric Data**: *Research Question*: What self‑supervised objectives (e.g., masked‑surface modeling, geometric rotation prediction, contrastive mesh embeddings) can be devised to pre‑train transformers on large, unlabeled collections of medical surfaces and volumetric scans? *Justification*: Current works rely on ImageNet pre‑training (a natural‑image domain gap) or limited small‑scale datasets, and the benefit of domain‑specific pre‑training remains unexplored. Developing geometry‑aware pre‑training will mitigate data scarcity, reduce over‑fitting, and unlock higher performance on downstream biomedical regression and classification tasks.\n- **Built‑in Equivariance and Deformation Invariance for Vision Transformers**: *Research Question*: How can rotational, reflectional, and elastic equivariance be embedded into transformer attention mechanisms (e.g., equivariant positional encodings, invariant query/key projections) to replace ad‑hoc augmentations? *Justification*: Several papers report reliance on limited rotation augmentations, sensitivity to input resolution, and absence of formal equivariance analysis. An architecture that is mathematically equivariant would improve robustness, simplify training pipelines, and provide a theoretical foundation missing from current studies.\n- **Unified Theoretical Framework for Projection‑Induced Biases and Attention Expressivity**: *Research Question*: What is the formal impact of surface projection (spherical, icosahedral, quadrangular) and attention design choices on model expressivity, inductive bias, and generalization in non‑Euclidean vision transformers? *Justification*: Many works acknowledge but do not analytically investigate how projection distortion, patch geometry, and attention complexity affect learning. A rigorous theory would guide principled architecture design, explain empirical gaps, and set performance bounds for future models.\n"
