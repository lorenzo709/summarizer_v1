        Analyze the following aggregated limitations and shortcomings from a series of papers
        centered around the topic of {topic}:
        
        {pro_limitation_points_input}
        
        Systematically categorize the common or recurring gaps in Methodology, Data, Scope, or Theory.
    
    expected_output: >
        A structured, continuous text report.
        
        The report must first present a **Synthesis of the Gaps** (1-2 paragraphs), followed by a bulleted list titled 
        **'High-Impact Research Opportunities'**.
        
        Each opportunity in the list must be:
        1. Clearly articulated as a research question or proposal.
        2. Directly justified by the aggregated shortcomings found in the input.
        3. Focused on advancing the field by filling a major 'hole' in the current State-of-the-Art.
