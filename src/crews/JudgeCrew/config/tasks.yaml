    description: >
      Meticulously assess a final scientific summary against its source material based on two critical criteria:
      1.  **Alignment (Precision/Faithfulness):** Check every claim in the 'final_summary' against the 'source_summaries'. Identify any factual errors or unsupported claims (hallucinations).
      2.  **Coverage (Recall):** Ensure all essential information, key findings, and crucial conclusions from the 'source_summaries' are accurately reflected in the 'final_summary'.

      You must provide a single numerical score from 0 to 5.

      **Inputs Provided:**
      - source_summaries: {source_summaries}
      - final_summary: {final_summary}
    expected_output: >
      A score from 0 to 5 measuring how much the final summary respect the criteria.
      If the score is less than 5(<5), then also return **Correction Hints** 
      **Correction Hint**: Provide concise, actionable advice on how to modify
      the final summary to address the Alignment and/or Coverage issues
      identified above and achieve a score of 5. Be specific about what needs
      to be added, removed, or rephrased.
